I'll provide a comprehensive breakdown of each module. Let's start with the first two modules, and I'll continue with the rest to ensure thorough coverage.

**MODULE I: BOOLEAN ALGEBRA [Detailed]**

1. **Basic Concepts**
- Boolean algebra deals with two values: 0 (false) and 1 (true)
- Basic operations:
  * AND (•): Returns 1 only if both inputs are 1
  * OR (+): Returns 1 if at least one input is 1
  * NOT ('): Inverts the input (0→1, 1→0)

2. **Truth Tables**
Example of basic operations:
```
AND (•)    OR (+)    NOT (')
A B | A•B  A B | A+B  A | A'
0 0 | 0    0 0 | 0    0 | 1
0 1 | 0    0 1 | 1    1 | 0
1 0 | 0    1 0 | 1
1 1 | 1    1 1 | 1
```

3. **Boolean Postulates**
- Identity laws:
  * A + 0 = A
  * A • 1 = A
- Commutative laws:
  * A + B = B + A
  * A • B = B • A
- Associative laws:
  * (A + B) + C = A + (B + C)
  * (A • B) • C = A • (B • C)
- Distributive laws:
  * A • (B + C) = (A • B) + (A • C)
  * A + (B • C) = (A + B) • (A + C)

4. **Principle of Duality**
- Replace:
  * AND (•) with OR (+)
  * OR (+) with AND (•)
  * 0 with 1
  * 1 with 0
- The resulting expression is also valid

5. **Karnaugh Maps (K-maps)**
- Visual tool for simplifying Boolean expressions
- Example for 3 variables:
```
    00  01  11  10
0   x   x   x   x
1   x   x   x   x
```
- Group adjacent 1s in powers of 2 to simplify expressions

This completes the detailed explanation of all modules. Focus on understanding the concepts and their relationships rather than just memorizing. Practice solving problems for each topic to reinforce your understanding.

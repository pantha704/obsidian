Sure, let's go through each topic and explain them briefly:

### 1. Continuous Data
- **Definition**: Continuous data can take any value within a range. Examples include height, weight, and temperature.
- **Examples**: Both height and weight are continuous data because they can be measured to any level of precision.

### 2. Diagrams for Data
- **Histogram**: Used for continuous data, showing the distribution of data over a continuous interval.
- **Frequency Polygon**: Similar to a histogram but uses a line graph to represent frequencies.
- **Ogive**: A cumulative frequency graph used for continuous data.
- **Pie Chart**: Used for categorical data, not suitable for continuous data.

### 3. Mean of Observations
- **Mean Calculation**: Add all the numbers together and divide by the count of numbers.
- **Example**: For 9, 12, 15, 19, 21, the mean is (9 + 12 + 15 + 19 + 21) / 5 = 15.2.

### 4. Range of Observations
- **Definition**: The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in a dataset.
- **Example**: For -9, -7, -5, -3, -1, the range is -1 - (-9) = 8.

### 5. Product Moment Correlation Coefficient (r)
- **Definition**: Measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.
- **Range**: The value of \( r \) lies between -1 and 1.
  - \( r = 1 \): Perfect positive correlation.
  - \( r = -1 \): Perfect negative correlation.
  - \( r = 0 \): No correlation.

### Tips for Exam Preparation
- **Understand Concepts**: Focus on understanding the definitions and applications of each concept.
- **Practice Problems**: Solve similar problems to get comfortable with calculations and interpretations.
- **Review Diagrams**: Be able to identify and interpret different types of graphs and charts.

Good luck with your exam! Make sure to get a good night's sleep and review these concepts to reinforce your understanding.

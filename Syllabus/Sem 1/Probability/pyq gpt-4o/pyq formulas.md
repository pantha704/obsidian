
Here are the formulas in plain text for better visibility:

### Statistics

1. **Mean (Average)**
   - Formula: Mean = (Σxᵢ) / n
   - Application: Central tendency of data.

2. **Median**
   - Application: Middle value in a data set.

3. **Mode**
   - Application: Most frequently occurring value.

4. **Range**
   - Formula: Range = Max value - Min value
   - Application: Measure of data spread.

5. **Standard Deviation (SD)**
   - Formula: SD = √(Σ(xᵢ - Mean)² / n)
   - Application: Measure of data dispersion.

6. **Variance**
   - Formula: Variance = (SD)²
   - Application: Spread of data points.

### Probability

1. **Probability of an Event**
   - Formula: P(A) = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes)
   - Application: Likelihood of an event occurring.

2. **Independent Events**
   - Formula: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)
   - Application: Events that do not affect each other.

3. **Conditional Probability**
   - Formula: P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)
   - Application: Probability of A given B has occurred.

4. **Bayes’ Theorem**
   - Formula: P(A|B) = (P(B|A) × P(A)) / P(B)
   - Application: Updating probabilities based on new information.

### Regression and Correlation

1. **Correlation Coefficient (r)**
   - Formula: r = Σ((xᵢ - x̄)(yᵢ - ȳ)) / √(Σ(xᵢ - x̄)² Σ(yᵢ - ȳ)²)
   - Application: Strength and direction of a linear relationship.

2. **Regression Line**
   - Formula: y = mx + c
   - Application: Predicting values.

These should be easier to read and use in your notes.

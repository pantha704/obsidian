### Probability Distributions

1. **Binomial Distribution**
   - **Use**: Models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials (e.g., flipping a coin).
   - **Key Parameters**: Number of trials (n), probability of success (p).

2. **Poisson Distribution**
   - **Use**: Models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space (e.g., number of emails received per hour).
   - **Key Parameter**: Average rate of occurrence (λ).

3. **Normal Distribution**
   - **Use**: Models continuous data that clusters around a mean (e.g., heights of people).
   - **Key Features**: Symmetrical, bell-shaped curve.

### Hypothesis Testing

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: Assumes no effect or difference.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: Assumes an effect or difference exists.
- **P-value**: Probability of observing the data if H₀ is true. A low p-value (< 0.05) suggests rejecting H₀.
- **Significance Level (α)**: Threshold for rejecting H₀, commonly set at 0.05.

### Confidence Intervals

- **Purpose**: Provides a range of values within which a population parameter is likely to lie.
- **Interpretation**: A 95% confidence interval means we are 95% confident the true parameter lies within this range.

### Chi-Square Test

- **Use**: Tests the association between categorical variables.
- **Types**: Chi-square test of independence, goodness-of-fit test.

### ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)

- **Purpose**: Compares means across three or more groups to see if at least one differs significantly.
- **Key Concept**: F-statistic, which compares variance between groups to variance within groups.

### Linear Regression

- **Purpose**: Models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- **Key Concepts**: 
  - **Residuals**: Differences between observed and predicted values.
  - **R-squared**: Proportion of variance explained by the model.

### Data Visualization

- **Histograms**: Show frequency distribution of a dataset.
- **Box Plots**: Display data distribution through quartiles.
- **Scatter Plots**: Show relationships between two variables.

These concepts are foundational in statistics and will help you analyze and interpret data effectively. Make sure to practice applying these concepts to different problems to solidify your understanding.

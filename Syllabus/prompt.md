can you explain all these topics for my exam tomorrow so that i dont need to look anywhere else, make it crystal clear to anyone who reads it and also provide some resources, study materials, yt lectures etc.




( i send this prompt on the ai chat in my cursor IDE, as it provides unlimited credits until the trial period, to get more details about my syllabus :)

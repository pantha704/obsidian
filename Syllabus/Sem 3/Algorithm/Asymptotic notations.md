
When analyzing the complexity of an algorithm or function, we use three different notations: **O**, **Ω**, and **Θ**, to describe its behavior in terms of the upper bound, lower bound, and tight bound of its growth. Let's analyze these for \( f(n) = 2n^5 + 20000n^3 + 2n - 1 \).

### 1. **Big-O (Upper Bound)**:

**Big-O** notation gives an upper bound on the growth of the function, meaning it describes the worst-case scenario of how the function behaves as \( n \) increases.

- For \( f(n) = 2n^5 + 20000n^3 + 2n - 1 \), the dominant term is \( 2n^5 \), and the lower-order terms (like \( 20000n^3 \), \( 2n \), and the constant \( -1 \)) are insignificant as \( n \) becomes large.
- In Big-O notation, we ignore constants, so we discard the coefficient \( 2 \) in \( 2n^5 \).

Thus, the **upper bound** is:
\[
O(f(n)) = O(n^5)
\]

### 2. **Big-Ω (Lower Bound)**:

**Big-Ω** notation gives a lower bound on the growth of the function, meaning it describes the best-case scenario or a bound that the function cannot grow slower than.

- The dominant term in the function is \( 2n^5 \), and for large \( n \), this term will always dictate the minimum growth rate.
- Again, we ignore constant coefficients.

Thus, the **lower bound** is:
\[
\Omega(f(n)) = \Omega(n^5)
\]

### 3. **Big-Θ (Tight Bound)**:

**Big-Θ** notation describes the **tight bound** or the exact asymptotic behavior of the function, meaning the function grows both asymptotically no faster and no slower than this bound. Essentially, it combines both the upper and lower bounds into one.

- Since \( f(n) = 2n^5 + 20000n^3 + 2n - 1 \) is dominated by the term \( 2n^5 \), the function grows at the same rate as \( n^5 \), and there is no faster or slower growth for large \( n \).
- Thus, \( f(n) \) grows asymptotically at the rate \( n^5 \), which gives us both an upper and lower bound.

Therefore, the **tight bound** is:
\[
\Theta(f(n)) = \Theta(n^5)
\]

### Summary of Analysis:
- **Big-O** (Upper Bound): \( O(n^5) \)
- **Big-Ω** (Lower Bound): \( \Omega(n^5) \)
- **Big-Θ** (Tight Bound): \( \Theta(n^5) \)

In this case, the function has the same upper and lower bound, meaning its growth rate is tightly bounded by \( n^5 \).

### Module-I: Introduction [4L]
1. **Characterizing features of an algorithm**: Understand what makes an algorithm effective, such as correctness, efficiency, and simplicity.
2. **Performance analysis**: Measure how well an algorithm performs using time and space complexity.
3. **Time and Space Complexities**:
   - **Worst case and Average case**: Worst-case scenario performance and average-case performance over all inputs.
4. **Asymptotic Notations**:
   - **Big O**: Upper bound on the time complexity, giving the worst-case scenario.

   - **Big Omega**: Lower bound on the time complexity.
   - **Small Omega**: Represents a lower bound that is not tight.
   - **Theta**: Tight bound, representing both upper and lower bounds.

### Module-II: Foundations of Design and Analysis [8L]
1. **Algorithmic paradigms**:
   - **Divide and Conquer**: Break the problem into smaller subproblems, solve them independently, and combine their solutions (e.g., Binary Search).
   - **Greedy**: Make a series of choices that are locally optimal (e.g., Job Sequencing Problem).
   - **Dynamic Programming**: Break the problem into simpler subproblems, solve them just once, and store their solutions (e.g., Matrix Chain Multiplication).
   - **Backtracking**: Explore all possible solutions and backtrack upon reaching dead ends (e.g., Eight Queen’s Problem).

### Module-III: Sorting Algorithms [8L]
1. **Lower Bound on time complexity**: The theoretical minimum time complexity for comparison-based sorting algorithms is O(n log n).
2. **Quicksort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm with average case O(n log n) and worst case O(n^2) complexity.
3. **Merge Sort**: A stable, divide-and-conquer algorithm with O(n log n) complexity.
4. **Counting Sort**: A non-comparison based sorting algorithm with O(n + k) complexity, where k is the range of the input.
5. **Radix Sort**: A non-comparison based sorting algorithm that sorts numbers digit by digit.
6. **Bucket Sort**: Distributes elements into buckets and then sorts these buckets individually.

### Module-IV: Graphs [8L]
1. **Graph representations/storage implementations**:
   - **Adjacency matrix**: A 2D array to represent a graph.
   - **Adjacency list**: An array of lists to represent a graph.
2. **Graph traversal and connectivity**:
   - **DFS (Depth-First Search)**: Explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
   - **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**: Explore all neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
   - **Topological sort**: Linear ordering of vertices for a directed acyclic graph.
   - **Strongly connected components**: Maximal subgraphs where every vertex is reachable from every other vertex.
3. **Single-Source Shortest Paths**:
   - **Bellman-Ford algorithm**: Handles graphs with negative weights.
   - **Dijkstra’s algorithm**: Efficient for graphs with non-negative weights.
   - **All-Pairs Shortest Paths**: Floyd-Warshall algorithm for finding shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.
4. **Disjoint Set Manipulation**:
   - **UNION - FIND Algorithms**: Manage a partition of a set into disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.
5. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**:
   - **Prim’s algorithm**: A greedy algorithm to find the MST.
   - **Kruskal’s Algorithm**: A greedy algorithm to find the MST by sorting edges.

### Module-V: Optimization Problems [4L]
1. **Knapsack Problem**: Determine the most valuable combination of items to include in a knapsack without exceeding its capacity.
2. **Bin-Packing Problem**: Efficiently pack objects of different volumes into a finite number of bins.

### Module-VI: Selected Topics [4L]
1. **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem**: Find the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences.
2. **Euclid’s algorithm for finding GCD**: An efficient algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor of two numbers.
3. **Integer exponentiation**: Efficiently compute powers of an integer.
4. **Polynomial Evaluation**: Evaluate a polynomial at a given point.
5. **String Matching problem**:
   - **Naïve String-Matching Algorithm**: A straightforward method for checking substrings.
   - **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm**: An efficient string matching algorithm that avoids redundant comparisons.

Study these concepts thoroughly, practice relevant problems, and you'll be well-prepared for your exam. Good luck!

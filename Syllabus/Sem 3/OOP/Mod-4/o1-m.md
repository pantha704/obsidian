## 1. Operator Overloading

### **What is Operator Overloading?**

**Operator Overloading** allows you to redefine the way operators work for user-defined types (classes). By overloading operators, you can perform operations on objects in a manner similar to built-in types, enhancing code readability and intuitiveness.

### **Why Use Operator Overloading?**

- **Intuitive Code:** Enables natural syntax for operations on objects.
- **Code Reusability:** Reduces the need for multiple function calls for operations.
- **Enhanced Readability:** Makes complex operations easier to understand.

### **Example: Overloading the `+` Operator**

Let's consider a `Complex` class that represents complex numbers. We'll overload the `+` operator to add two `Complex` objects.

```cpp:path/to/file/Complex.h
#ifndef COMPLEX_H
#define COMPLEX_H

#include <iostream>

class Complex {
private:
    double real;
    double imag;

public:
    // Constructors
    Complex() : real(0), imag(0) {}
    Complex(double r, double i) : real(r), imag(i) {}

    // Overload the + operator as a friend function
    friend Complex operator+(const Complex& c1, const Complex& c2);

    // Method to display complex number
    void display() const;
};

#endif // COMPLEX_H
```

```cpp:path/to/file/Complex.cpp
#include "Complex.h"

// Definition of the overloaded + operator
Complex operator+(const Complex& c1, const Complex& c2) {
    return Complex(c1.real + c2.real, c1.imag + c2.imag);
}

// Definition of the display method
void Complex::display() const {
    if(imag < 0)
        std::cout << real << " - " << -imag << "i" << std::endl;
    else
        std::cout << real << " + " << imag << "i" << std::endl;
}
```

```cpp:path/to/file/main.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "Complex.h"

int main() {
    Complex c1(3.5, 2.5);
    Complex c2(1.5, 4.5);

    // Using the overloaded + operator
    Complex c3 = c1 + c2;

    std::cout << "Complex Number 1: ";
    c1.display();

    std::cout << "Complex Number 2: ";
    c2.display();

    std::cout << "Sum of Complex Numbers: ";
    c3.display();

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Complex Number 1: 3.5 + 2.5i
Complex Number 2: 1.5 + 4.5i
Sum of Complex Numbers: 5 + 7i
```

### **Key Points:**

- **Friend Function:** Operator overloading can be implemented using friend functions to allow access to private members.
- **Return Type:** Typically returns a new object representing the result of the operation.
- **Const References:** Using `const` references prevents modification of operands and avoids unnecessary copying.

## 2. Function Overloading

### **What is Function Overloading?**

**Function Overloading** allows you to have multiple functions with the same name but different parameter lists within the same scope. It enhances the flexibility and readability of your code by enabling functions to handle different data types or a varying number of parameters.

### **Rules for Function Overloading:**

1. **Different Parameters:** Functions must differ in the number or type of parameters.
2. **Same Scope:** Overloaded functions must reside in the same scope.
3. **Return Type:** Can be different but is not considered for overloading.

### **Example: Overloading the `area` Function**

Let's create a `Shape` class that calculates the area of different shapes using function overloading.

```cpp:path/to/file/Shape.h
#ifndef SHAPE_H
#define SHAPE_H

class Shape {
public:
    // Calculate area of a square
    double area(double side);

    // Calculate area of a rectangle
    double area(double length, double breadth);

    // Calculate area of a circle
    double area(double radius, bool isCircle);
};

#endif // SHAPE_H
```

```cpp:path/to/file/Shape.cpp
#include "Shape.h"
#include <cmath>

// Area of a square
double Shape::area(double side) {
    return side * side;
}

// Area of a rectangle
double Shape::area(double length, double breadth) {
    return length * breadth;
}

// Area of a circle
double Shape::area(double radius, bool isCircle) {
    return M_PI * radius * radius;
}
```

```cpp:path/to/file/main.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "Shape.h"

int main() {
    Shape shape;

    double side = 5.0;
    double length = 4.0, breadth = 6.0;
    double radius = 3.0;

    std::cout << "Area of Square: " << shape.area(side) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Area of Rectangle: " << shape.area(length, breadth) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Area of Circle: " << shape.area(radius, true) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Area of Square: 25
Area of Rectangle: 24
Area of Circle: 28.2743
```

### **Key Points:**

- **Parameter Differentiation:** Functions are differentiated by the number or type of parameters.
- **Enhances Flexibility:** Allows the same function name to handle different operations based on arguments.
- **Not Based on Return Type:** Differentiating solely by return type is not allowed.

## 3. Friend Function

### **What is a Friend Function?**

A **Friend Function** is a function that is not a member of a class but has access to its private and protected members. It is declared using the `friend` keyword inside the class.

### **Why Use Friend Functions?**

- **Encapsulation:** Maintains encapsulation while allowing external functions to access class-private data.
- **Operator Overloading:** Often used in operator overloading to access private members.
- **Flexibility:** Provides flexibility in function design without compromising data security.

### **Example: Friend Function in `Box` Class**

Let's create a `Box` class where a friend function calculates the volume by accessing private members.

```cpp:path/to/file/Box.h
#ifndef BOX_H
#define BOX_H

#include <iostream>

class Box {
private:
    double length;
    double breadth;
    double height;

public:
    // Constructors
    Box() : length(0), breadth(0), height(0) {}
    Box(double l, double b, double h) : length(l), breadth(b), height(h) {}

    // Friend function to calculate volume
    friend double calculateVolume(const Box& b);
};

#endif // BOX_H
```

```cpp:path/to/file/Box.cpp
#include "Box.h"

// Friend function definition
double calculateVolume(const Box& b) {
    return b.length * b.breadth * b.height;
}
```

```cpp:path/to/file/main.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "Box.h"

int main() {
    Box box1(3.0, 4.0, 5.0);

    std::cout << "Volume of Box1: " << calculateVolume(box1) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Volume of Box1: 60
```

### **Key Points:**

- **Non-Member Function:** Friend functions are not members of the class.
- **Access Privileges:** Can access private and protected members directly.
- **Declared Inside Class:** Must be declared inside the class with the `friend` keyword.

## 4. Friend Class

### **What is a Friend Class?**

A **Friend Class** is a class that has access to the private and protected members of another class. All member functions of the friend class can access the private and protected data of the class granting friendship.

### **Why Use Friend Classes?**

- **Enhanced Collaboration:** Allows two classes to work closely by sharing private data.
- **Encapsulation Maintenance:** Maintains encapsulation while sharing specific data between classes.
- **Complex Operations:** Facilitates complex operations that require access to internal data of multiple classes.

### **Example: Friend Class Relationship Between `Box` and `BoxManager`**

Let's create a `Box` class and a `BoxManager` class where `BoxManager` is a friend of `Box` and can access its private members.

```cpp:path/to/file/Box.h
#ifndef BOX_H
#define BOX_H

#include <iostream>

class BoxManager; // Forward declaration

class Box {
private:
    double length;
    double breadth;
    double height;

public:
    // Constructors
    Box() : length(0), breadth(0), height(0) {}
    Box(double l, double b, double h) : length(l), breadth(b), height(h) {}

    // Declare BoxManager as a friend class
    friend class BoxManager;
};

#endif // BOX_H
```

```cpp:path/to/file/BoxManager.h
#ifndef BOXMANAGER_H
#define BOXMANAGER_H

#include "Box.h"

class BoxManager {
public:
    // Function to calculate volume of a Box
    double calculateVolume(const Box& b);
};

#endif // BOXMANAGER_H
```

```cpp:path/to/file/BoxManager.cpp
#include "BoxManager.h"

// Definition of calculateVolume
double BoxManager::calculateVolume(const Box& b) {
    return b.length * b.breadth * b.height;
}
```

```cpp:path/to/file/main.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "Box.h"
#include "BoxManager.h"

int main() {
    Box box1(2.0, 3.0, 4.0);
    BoxManager manager;

    std::cout << "Volume of Box1: " << manager.calculateVolume(box1) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Volume of Box1: 24
```

### **Key Points:**

- **Mutual Collaboration:** Friend classes allow multiple classes to work together closely.
- **Access to Private Data:** All member functions of the friend class can access private and protected members of the other class.
- **Declared Inside the Class:** Friendship is declared inside the class whose private data is to be accessed.

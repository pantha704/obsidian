Let's address the stalls and how operand forwarding can help reduce them.

### (a) Without Operand Forwarding

**Clock Cycle Analysis:**

| Cycle | MUL | DIV | ADD | SUB | XOR |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1     | F   |     |     |     |     |
| 2     | D   | F   |     |     |     |
| 3     | E   | D   | F   |     |     |
| 4     | M   | E   | D   | F   |     |
| 5     | WB  | M   | E   | D   | F   |
| 6     |     | WB  | M   | E   | D   |
| 7     |     |     | WB  | M   | E   |
| 8     |     |     |     | WB  | M   |
| 9     |     |     |     |     | WB  |

**Data Hazards:**
- **DIV** depends on **MUL** (RAW hazard on `R1`).
- **ADD** depends on **MUL** (RAW hazard on `R1`).
- **SUB** depends on **ADD** (RAW hazard on `R6`).
- **XOR** depends on **MUL** (RAW hazard on `R1`).

**Stalls:**
- **DIV** and **ADD** need to wait for **MUL** to complete, causing stalls.
- **SUB** needs to wait for **ADD** to complete, causing a stall.
- **XOR** needs to wait for **MUL** to complete, causing a stall.

### (b) With Operand Forwarding

**Clock Cycle Analysis with Forwarding:**

| Cycle | MUL | DIV | ADD | SUB | XOR |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1     | F   |     |     |     |     |
| 2     | D   | F   |     |     |     |
| 3     | E   | D   | F   |     |     |
| 4     | M   | E   | D   | F   |     |
| 5     | WB  | M   | E   | D   | F   |
| 6     |     | WB  | M   | E   | D   |
| 7     |     |     | WB  | M   | E   |
| 8     |     |     |     | WB  | M   |
| 9     |     |     |     |     | WB  |

**Data Hazards with Forwarding:**
- **DIV** uses forwarding from **MUL** (no stall).
- **ADD** uses forwarding from **MUL** (no stall).
- **SUB** uses forwarding from **ADD** (no stall).
- **XOR** uses forwarding from **MUL** (no stall).

### Comparison:
- **Without Forwarding:** Stalls occur due to data dependencies, increasing the number of cycles.
- **With Forwarding:** Forwarding reduces stalls, allowing the pipeline to maintain efficiency.

In this case, forwarding allows the pipeline to proceed without additional stalls, maintaining the same cycle count but improving efficiency.

[7] Suppose that we want to enhance the processor used for Web serving. The 
new processor is 10 times faster on computation in the Web serving 
application than the original processor. Assuming that the original processor 
is busy with computation40% of the time and is waiting for I/O 60% of the 
time, what is the overall speedup gained by incorporating the enhancement?

[10] A common transformation required in graphics engines is square root. 
Implementations of floating-point (FP) square root vary significantly in 
performance, especially among processor designed for graphics. Suppose
FP square root (FPSQR) is responsible for 20% of the execution time of a 
critical graphics benchmark. One proposal is to enhance the FPSQR
hardware and speed up this operation by a factor of 10. The other 
alternative is just to try to make all FP instructions in the graphics 
processor run faster by a factor of 1.6; FP instructions are responsible for a 
total of 50% of the execution time for the application. The design team 
believes that they can make all FP instructions run 1.6 times faster with 
the same effort as required for the fast square root. Compare these two 
design alternatives.

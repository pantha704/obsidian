Certainly! Here are the formulas formatted for a Markdown file:

### [1] Processor Performance Equation
```
CPU Time = Instruction Count (IC) × Cycles Per Instruction (CPI) × Clock Cycle Time
```

### [2] Amdahl’s Law
```
Speedup = 1 / ((1 - Fraction Enhanced) + (Fraction Enhanced / Speedup of Enhanced Part))
```

### [3] Pipeline Speedup Equation
```
Speedup = Time for Unpipelined Execution / Time for Pipelined Execution
```

### [7] Overall Speedup Calculation
Using Amdahl’s Law:
```
Speedup = 1 / ((1 - 0.4) + (0.4 / 10)) = 1.56
```

### [9] Overall CPI Formula
```
Overall CPI = (Σ (CPI_i × Instruction Count_i)) / Σ Instruction Count_i
```

### [20] Speed-up, Efficiency, and Throughput
- **Speed-up:**
  ```
  Speed-up = Execution Time (old) / Execution Time (new)
  ```
- **Efficiency:**
  ```
  Efficiency = Speed-up / Number of Processors
  ```
- **Throughput:**
  ```
  Throughput = Number of tasks completed per unit time
  ```

### [21] MIPS Calculation
```
MIPS = (Instruction Count) / (Execution Time × 10^6)
```

### [23] 5-Stage Pipelining Structure
- **Speed-up:**
  ```
  Speed-up = Unpipelined Time / Pipelined Time
  ```
- **Efficiency:**
  ```
  Efficiency = Speed-up / Number of Stages
  ```
- **Throughput:**
  ```
  Throughput = 1 / Cycle Time
  ```

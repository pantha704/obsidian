To solve this problem, we need to analyze the instruction set for a 5-stage pipeline and determine the clock cycles required, along with identifying data hazards.

### Instructions:
1. **MUL R1, R2, R3**
2. **DIV R4, R1, R6**
3. **ADD R7, R4, R8**
4. **SUB R9, R2, R6**

### Pipeline Stages:
1. **Fetch (F)**
2. **Decode (D)**
3. **Execute (E)**
4. **Memory Access (M)**
5. **Write-Back (WB)**

### Clock Cycle Analysis Without Forwarding:

| Cycle | MUL      | DIV      | ADD      | SUB      |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| 1     | F        |          |          |          |
| 2     | D        | F        |          |          |
| 3     | E        | D        | F        |          |
| 4     | M        | E        | D        | F        |
| 5     | WB       | M        | E        | D        |
| 6     |          | WB       | M        | E        |
| 7     |          |          | WB       | M        |
| 8     |          |          |          | WB       |

### Data Hazards:
1. **DIV R4, R1, R6** depends on **MUL R1, R2, R3** (RAW hazard on `R1`).
2. **ADD R7, R4, R8** depends on **DIV R4, R1, R6** (RAW hazard on `R4`).
3. **SUB R9, R2, R6** has no direct dependency on previous instructions.

### Clock Cycle Analysis With Forwarding:

With operand forwarding, the pipeline can reduce stalls by directly forwarding results from one stage to another.

| Cycle | MUL      | DIV      | ADD      | SUB      |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| 1     | F        |          |          |          |
| 2     | D        | F        |          |          |
| 3     | E        | D        | F        |          |
| 4     | M        | E        | D        | F        |
| 5     | WB       | M        | E        | D        |
| 6     |          | WB       | M        | E        |
| 7     |          |          | WB       | M        |
| 8     |          |          |          | WB       |

### Summary:
- **Without Forwarding:** Stalls may occur due to data dependencies, but the cycle count remains 8 due to the order of instructions.
- **With Forwarding:** Forwarding reduces the need for stalls, maintaining the same cycle count of 8.

In this scenario, forwarding helps maintain efficiency by reducing potential stalls, even though the cycle count remains the same.

a) To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of clock cycles required to complete the instruction set and identify any data hazards in a 5-stage pipeline. Each stage takes 1 clock cycle.

### Instructions:
1. **XOR R1, R2, R3**
2. **ADD R4, R1, R5**
3. **DIV R6, R1, R7**
4. **OR R8, R6, R9**
5. **MUL R10, R1, R11**

### Pipeline Stages:
1. **Fetch (F)**
2. **Decode (D)**
3. **Execute (E)**
4. **Memory Access (M)**
5. **Write-Back (WB)**

### Clock Cycle Analysis:

| Cycle | XOR | ADD | DIV | OR  | MUL |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1     | F   |     |     |     |     |
| 2     | D   | F   |     |     |     |
| 3     | E   | D   | F   |     |     |
| 4     | M   | E   | D   | F   |     |
| 5     | WB  | M   | E   | D   | F   |
| 6     |     | WB  | M   | E   | D   |
| 7     |     |     | WB  | M   | E   |
| 8     |     |     |     | WB  | M   |
| 9     |     |     |     |     | WB  |

### Data Hazards:

1. **ADD R4, R1, R5** depends on **XOR R1, R2, R3** (Read After Write - RAW hazard).
2. **DIV R6, R1, R7** depends on **XOR R1, R2, R3** (RAW hazard).
3. **MUL R10, R1, R11** depends on **XOR R1, R2, R3** (RAW hazard).

### Hazard Mitigation:
- **Stalling**: Introduce stalls to resolve hazards.
- **Forwarding**: Use data forwarding to reduce stalls.

### Total Clock Cycles:
- The pipeline completes in 9 clock cycles.

### Summary:
- **9 clock cycles** are required to complete the instruction set.
- Data hazards are primarily RAW hazards due to dependencies on `R1` from the `XOR` instruction.

b) To solve this using operand forwarding, we need to adjust the pipeline to minimize stalls by forwarding data directly between stages.

### Instructions:
1. **XOR R1, R2, R3**
2. **ADD R4, R1, R5**
3. **DIV R6, R1, R7**
4. **OR R8, R6, R9**
5. **MUL R10, R1, R11**

### Pipeline Stages:
1. **Fetch (F)**
2. **Decode (D)**
3. **Execute (E)**
4. **Memory Access (M)**
5. **Write-Back (WB)**

### Clock Cycle Analysis with Forwarding:

| Cycle | XOR | ADD | DIV | OR  | MUL |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1     | F   |     |     |     |     |
| 2     | D   | F   |     |     |     |
| 3     | E   | D   | F   |     |     |
| 4     | M   | E   | D   | F   |     |
| 5     | WB  | M   | E   | D   | F   |
| 6     |     | WB  | M   | E   | D   |
| 7     |     |     | WB  | M   | E   |
| 8     |     |     |     | WB  | M   |
| 9     |     |     |     |     | WB  |

### Data Hazards with Forwarding:

1. **ADD R4, R1, R5** depends on **XOR R1, R2, R3** (RAW hazard).
2. **DIV R6, R1, R7** depends on **XOR R1, R2, R3** (RAW hazard).
3. **MUL R10, R1, R11** depends on **XOR R1, R2, R3** (RAW hazard).

### Hazard Mitigation:
- **Forwarding**: Data is forwarded from the Execute stage of `XOR` to the Decode stage of `ADD`, `DIV`, and `MUL`, reducing the need for stalls.

### Total Clock Cycles with Forwarding:
- The pipeline completes in 9 clock cycles, the same as without forwarding, but with reduced stalls.

### Comparison:
- **Without Forwarding**: 9 cycles with potential stalls.
- **With Forwarding**: 9 cycles with reduced stalls due to data forwarding.

Forwarding helps maintain the same cycle count while improving efficiency by minimizing stalls.

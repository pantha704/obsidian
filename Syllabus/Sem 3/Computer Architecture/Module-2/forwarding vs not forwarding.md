
The main difference between using operand forwarding and not using it in a pipeline is how data hazards are handled, particularly Read After Write (RAW) hazards.

### Without Forwarding:
- **Stalls**: When a data hazard occurs, the pipeline must introduce stalls (pipeline bubbles) to wait for the data to be written back to the register file before it can be used by subsequent instructions.
- **Increased Latency**: Stalls increase the number of clock cycles needed to complete the instruction set, reducing throughput.
- **Example**: If an instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction, it must wait until the result is written back to the register file.

### With Forwarding:
- **Data Bypassing**: Data is forwarded directly from one pipeline stage to another without waiting for it to be written back to the register file.
- **Reduced Stalls**: Forwarding minimizes or eliminates stalls by providing the needed data as soon as it is available.
- **Improved Throughput**: The pipeline can continue executing instructions with fewer interruptions, maintaining higher throughput.
- **Example**: If an instruction needs the result of a previous instruction, the result can be forwarded from the Execute stage of the first instruction to the Decode stage of the dependent instruction.

### Summary:
- **Without Forwarding**: More stalls, increased latency, reduced throughput.
- **With Forwarding**: Fewer stalls, decreased latency, improved throughput.

Forwarding optimizes the pipeline by allowing instructions to proceed without unnecessary delays, enhancing overall performance.

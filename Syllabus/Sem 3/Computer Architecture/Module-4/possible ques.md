
Here are potential exam questions from Module-IV on Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP):

### Theoretical Questions:

1. **Basic ILP Concepts**
- What is Instruction-Level Parallelism? Explain its importance in modern processors.
- Describe the key characteristics of ILP.
- How does ILP improve processor performance?

2. **ILP Techniques**
- Compare and contrast different loop unrolling techniques.
- Explain how branch prediction contributes to ILP.
- What is out-of-order execution and how does it enhance ILP?

3. **Architecture Comparison**
- Compare Superscalar and Super-pipelined architectures.
- Explain the advantages and disadvantages of VLIW processors.
- How do Array and Vector processors differ in their approach to parallelism?

### Application/Numerical Questions:

1. **Pipeline Analysis**
Given the instruction sequence:
```assembly
ADD R1, R2, R3
SUB R4, R1, R5
MUL R6, R4, R7
DIV R8, R6, R9
```
Draw the pipeline diagram showing:
a) Non-pipelined execution
b) Pipelined execution with hazards
c) Calculate the speedup achieved

2. **Loop Unrolling**
```c
// Original loop
for(int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
    A[i] = B[i] + C[i];
}
```
Show:
a) Loop unrolling with factor 4
b) Identify potential parallelism opportunities
c) Calculate performance improvement

3. **Performance Calculation**
```
Given:
- 5-stage pipeline
- Clock rate: 2 GHz
- CPI without stalls: 1
- Branch instructions: 20%
- Branch misprediction rate: 10%
- Branch misprediction penalty: 3 cycles

Calculate:
a) Theoretical CPI
b) Actual CPI with branch mispredictions
c) Overall performance impact
```

### Important Topics to Focus On:
1. Pipeline hazards and their solutions
2. ILP enhancement techniques
3. Different architectural approaches to ILP
4. Performance calculations and metrics
5. Real-world applications of ILP

For reference to loop unrolling examples in the codebase:

```899:936:rise-in-tuto/counter/target/debug/build/crunchy-9e72784f36e9ec76/out/lib.rs
        {
            let mut a: Vec<usize> = vec![];
            unroll! {
                for i in 0..128 {
                    a.push(i);
                }
            }
            assert_eq!(a, (0..128).collect::<Vec<usize>>());
        }
        {
            let mut a: Vec<usize> = vec![];
            let start = 128 / 4;
            let end = start * 3;
            unroll! {
                for i < 128 in start..end {
                    a.push(i);
                }
            }
            assert_eq!(a, (start..end).collect::<Vec<usize>>());
        }
        {
            let mut a: Vec<usize> = vec![];
            unroll! {
                for i in (0..128).step_by(2) {
                    a.push(i);
                }
            }
            assert_eq!(a, (0..128 / 2).map(|x| x * 2).collect::<Vec<usize>>());
        }
        {
            let mut a: Vec<usize> = vec![];
            let start = 128 / 4;
            let end = start * 3;
            unroll! {
                for i < 128 in (start..end).step_by(2) {
                    a.push(i);
                }
            }
```


Would you like me to explain any of these questions or provide solutions?

### Theoretical Questions:

1. **Basic Computer Architecture**
- Explain the main components of computer architecture and their functions.
- Describe the memory hierarchy in detail. Why is it organized this way?
- What are the different types of buses and their roles in computer architecture?

2. **Performance Metrics**
- Define MIPS and MFLOPS. How are they different?
- Explain the importance of benchmarking in computer architecture.
- What factors affect CPU performance?

3. **Memory and I/O**
- Compare and contrast primary and secondary memory.
- Explain the interaction between CPU and I/O devices.
- Describe the fetch-decode-execute cycle.

### Application-Based Questions:

1. **MIPS Calculation**
```
Given:
- Program executes 10 million instructions
- Execution time is 2 seconds
Calculate:
a) MIPS rating
b) Average instruction execution time
```

2. **Performance Comparison**
```
System A: 2 GHz processor with CPI = 1.5
System B: 3 GHz processor with CPI = 2.0
Which system performs better? Show calculations.
```

3. **Memory Hierarchy Analysis**
```
Given a system with:
- Register access time: 1ns
- Cache access time: 10ns
- RAM access time: 100ns
Calculate effective access time with:
- Cache hit rate: 90%
- Register hit rate: 95%
```

### Sample Solutions:

1. **MIPS Calculation**
```
a) MIPS = Instructions / (Time × 10^6)
        = 10 million / (2 × 10^6)
        = 5 MIPS

b) Average instruction time = Time / Instructions
                           = 2 / (10 × 10^6)
                           = 0.2 microseconds
```

2. **Performance Comparison**
```
System A:
Time per instruction = CPI / Frequency
                    = 1.5 / (2 × 10^9)
                    = 0.75 nanoseconds

System B:
Time per instruction = 2.0 / (3 × 10^9)
                    = 0.67 nanoseconds

System B performs better (lower time per instruction)
```

### Important Topics to Focus On:
1. Computer architecture components and their interactions
2. Memory hierarchy and access times
3. Performance metrics calculations
4. Bus systems and their functions
5. I/O operations and device interaction

I'll help you solve this exam paper. Let's go through it section by section:

Group A (1 mark each):

1. (i) 2^n - When converting NFA to DFA, maximum possible states is 2^n
(ii) Finite State Machine - Transition table represents FSM
(iii) Unique path to all other state for every input symbol - This is the definition of DFA
(iv) Moore Machine - A shift register is a type of Moore machine
(v) 0 - Finite automata doesn't require any stacks (PDA needs stack)
(vi) Type 3 Grammar - Regular grammar is Type 3
(vii) 16 - For 2 states and binary input (0,1), total possible DFAs = 2^(2*2) = 16
(viii) The set of all strings containing at least two 1's
(ix) L is not regular language - a^nb^n is not regular
(x) Must contain any combination of a,b or null string - This is what a* + b* represents

For Group B and C, which specific questions would you like me to focus on? Given your exam is today, I can prioritize the most important ones.

Key questions to focus on would be:
1. The pumping lemma proof (Q5)
2. DFA construction questions (Q6)
3. PDA construction (Q9)
4. Turing machine for palindromes (Q10b)
5. Ambiguous grammar analysis (Q11)

Which of these would you like me to explain in detail?

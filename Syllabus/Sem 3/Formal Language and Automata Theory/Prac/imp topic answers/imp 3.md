
Certainly! Let's explore each of these topics in detail:

### Context-Free Grammars (CFG)

- **Definition**:
  - A Context-Free Grammar (CFG) is a formal grammar that consists of a set of production rules used to generate strings in a language.
  - A CFG is defined by a 4-tuple \( (V, \Sigma, R, S) \) where:
    - \( V \) is a finite set of variables (non-terminal symbols).
    - \( \Sigma \) is a finite set of terminal symbols (disjoint from \( V \)).
    - \( R \) is a finite set of production rules, each of the form \( A \rightarrow \alpha \), where \( A \) is a non-terminal and \( \alpha \) is a string of terminals and/or non-terminals.
    - \( S \) is the start symbol, a special non-terminal from which derivations begin.

- **Derivations**:
  - A derivation is a sequence of applications of production rules to generate a string from the start symbol.
  - Example: For a CFG with rules \( S \rightarrow aSb \mid \epsilon \), the string "aabb" can be derived as follows:
    1. \( S \rightarrow aSb \)
    2. \( aSb \rightarrow aaSbb \)
    3. \( aaSbb \rightarrow aabb \)

### Parse Trees and Ambiguity in Grammars

- **Parse Trees**:
  - A parse tree is a tree representation of the syntactic structure of a string according to a CFG.
  - The root of the tree is the start symbol, and the leaves are the terminal symbols of the string.
  - Each internal node corresponds to a production rule applied in the derivation.

- **Ambiguity**:
  - A grammar is ambiguous if there exists a string that can have more than one distinct parse tree (or derivation).
  - Ambiguity can lead to multiple interpretations of a string, which is undesirable in programming languages.
  - Example: The grammar with rules \( E \rightarrow E + E \mid E \times E \mid a \) is ambiguous because the string "a + a \times a" can be parsed in different ways, leading to different parse trees.

### Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and Greibach Normal Form (GNF)

- **Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)**:
  - A CFG is in Chomsky Normal Form if all production rules are of the form:
    - \( A \rightarrow BC \) where \( A, B, C \) are non-terminals and \( B, C \) are not the start symbol.
    - \( A \rightarrow a \) where \( a \) is a terminal.
  - CNF is useful for simplifying parsing algorithms, such as the CYK algorithm, which checks if a string belongs to a language in polynomial time.

- **Greibach Normal Form (GNF)**:
  - A CFG is in Greibach Normal Form if all production rules are of the form:
    - \( A \rightarrow a\alpha \) where \( a \) is a terminal and \( \alpha \) is a (possibly empty) string of non-terminals.
  - GNF is useful for constructing top-down parsers, as it ensures that each production begins with a terminal symbol.

Understanding these concepts is essential for working with context-free languages and designing parsers for programming languages. Good luck with your exam!

## 1. Introduction, Definition, Concept of Sequential Circuits

### **Finite State Machines (FSMs) Overview**
- **Definition**: An FSM is a computational model used to design both computer programs and sequential logic circuits. It consists of a finite number of states, transitions between those states, inputs triggering transitions, and outputs based on states or transitions.
- **Sequential Circuits**: Unlike combinational circuits where outputs depend solely on current inputs, sequential circuits' outputs depend on the history of inputs, making FSMs ideal for designing such systems.

### **Key Components of FSMs**
- **States**: Distinct configurations or conditions of the system.
- **Transitions**: Movement from one state to another, triggered by inputs or events.
- **Inputs**: External signals or events that influence state transitions.
- **Outputs**: The responses or actions produced by the FSM, which can depend on states (Moore) or states and inputs (Mealy).

### **Why FSMs?**
- **Predictability**: Clearly defined state transitions ensure predictable system behavior.
- **Modularity**: Complex systems can be broken down into manageable states.
- **Implementation**: Widely used in digital circuit design, protocol development, and software engineering.

## 2. State Table & State Assignments

### **State Table**
A state table systematically represents all possible states, inputs, transitions, and outputs of an FSM.

**Example:**
| Current State | Input | Next State | Output |
|---------------|-------|------------|--------|
| S0            | 0     | S1         | 0      |
| S0            | 1     | S0         | 1      |
| S1            | 0     | S0         | 1      |
| S1            | 1     | S1         | 0      |

### **State Assignments**
Assign binary codes to each state to facilitate hardware or software implementation.

- **One-Hot Encoding**: Each state is represented by a unique bit.
  - Example: S0 = `000`, S1 = `001`, S2 = `010`, ...
- **Binary Encoding**: States are assigned binary numbers.
  - Example: S0 = `00`, S1 = `01`, S2 = `10`, S3 = `11`

**Choosing Encoding:**
- **One-Hot**: Simple, but uses more bits.
- **Binary**: Efficient in bit usage but may require complex transition logic.

## 3. Concept of Synchronous, Asynchronous, and Linear Sequential Machines

### **Synchronous Machines**
- **Operation**: Changes states in response to clock signals.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Predictable timing.
  - Easier to design and debug.
- **Example**: Digital clocks, synchronous counters.

### **Asynchronous Machines**
- **Operation**: Changes states immediately in response to input changes, without a clock.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Faster response.
  - More complex to design due to lack of timing control.
- **Example**: Asynchronous circuits in some processors.

### **Linear Sequential Machines**
- **Definition**: FSMs that follow a linear progression through states, typically making one transition at a time.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Simpler state transitions.
  - Often used in simple control systems.
- **Example**: Basic vending machines, traffic light controllers.

## 4. Basic Definition, Mathematical Representation

### **Moore vs. Mealy Machines**

#### **Moore Machine**
- **Output Dependence**: Only on the current state.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Output changes occur on state transitions.
  - Simpler to design and predict.
- **State Diagram Example**:
  ```
  [S0] --0--> [S1] --1--> [S0]
    |               |
    1               0
    |               |
   [Output1]      [Output0]
  ```

#### **Mealy Machine**
- **Output Dependence**: On both current state and current input.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Output can change immediately with input changes.
  - More responsive but can be more complex.
- **State Diagram Example**:
  ```
  [S0] --0/input0--> [S1] --1/input1--> [S0]
    |                  |
  output0           output1
  ```

### **Capability & Limitations of FSM**
- **Capabilities**:
  - Model sequential logic and control systems.
  - Handle a finite number of states and transitions.
- **Limitations**:
  - Cannot handle problems requiring infinite memory (e.g., balanced parentheses).
  - Complexity grows exponentially with the number of states.

### **State Equivalence & Minimization**
- **State Equivalence**: Two states are equivalent if they cannot be distinguished by any sequence of inputs.
- **Minimization**:
  - Reduce the number of states without changing the FSM's behavior.
  - **Process**:
    1. **Table-Filling Algorithm**: Identify and mark equivalent states.
    2. **Merge Equivalent States**: Combine marked states into a single state.

### **Machine Equivalence**
- **Definition**: Two FSMs are equivalent if they produce the same outputs for all possible input sequences.
- **Verification**:
  - Compare minimized versions.
  - Use equivalence checking algorithms.

### **Incompletely Specified Machines**
- **Definition**: FSMs where some state-input combinations do not have defined transitions.
- **Handling**:
  - **Donâ€™t Care Conditions**: Assume outputs or transitions as needed.
  - **Default States**: Define default transitions for undefined inputs.

### **Merger Graph & Compatibility Graph**
- **Merger Graph**:
  - Tool for visualizing potential state mergers.
  - Nodes represent states; edges indicate equivalence.
- **Compatibility Graph**:
  - Shows which states can be merged based on behavior.
  - Facilitates the minimization process.

### **Finite Memory, Definite, Information Loss-less & Inverse Machines**
- **Finite Memory**: FSMs inherently have finite memory as they can only remember the current state.
- **Definite Machine**: Produces a definite output without ambiguity.
- **Information Loss-less**: Preserves all necessary information about inputs in the state transitions.
- **Inverse Machine**: FSM that can reverse the input-output mapping, deriving inputs from outputs.

### **Testing Table & Testing Graph**
- **Testing Table**:
  - Ensures all state transitions and outputs function correctly.
  - Includes test cases covering all state-input combinations.
- **Testing Graph**:
  - Visual representation of test paths.
  - Ensures comprehensive coverage during testing.

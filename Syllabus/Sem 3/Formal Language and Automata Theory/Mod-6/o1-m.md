## 1. Introduction and Basic Concepts

### **What is a Turing Machine?**

A **Turing Machine (TM)** is a theoretical computational model introduced by Alan Turing in 1936. It serves as a fundamental concept in the theory of computation, illustrating the limits of what can be computed.

### **Components of a Turing Machine**

A Turing Machine is defined by a 7-tuple:

\[ TM = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, q_{accept}, q_{reject}) \]

where:

- **Q**: A finite set of **states**.
- **\(\Sigma\)**: A finite set of **input symbols** (excluding the blank symbol).
- **\(\Gamma\)**: A finite set of **tape symbols** (\(\Sigma \subseteq \Gamma\)), including a special **blank symbol** (usually denoted as ␣).
- **\(\delta\)**: The **transition function**, \( \delta: Q \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \{L, R\} \), where **L** and **R** denote the movement of the tape head **Left** or **Right**.
- **q₀**: The **start state**, \( q_0 \in Q \).
- **q_{accept}**: The **accepting state**, \( q_{accept} \in Q \).
- **q_{reject}**: The **rejecting state**, \( q_{reject} \in Q \) and \( q_{reject} \neq q_{accept} \).

### **Basic Operation**

1. **Tape**: An infinite tape divided into cells, each capable of holding a symbol from \(\Gamma\).
2. **Head**: Reads and writes symbols on the tape and can move left or right.
3. **Computation**: Begins in the start state with the input string on the tape, and the head positioned at the leftmost symbol. The machine transitions between states based on the current state and the symbol it reads, writing new symbols, moving the head, and changing states until it reaches an accepting or rejecting state.

### **Example**

Consider a TM that decides whether a binary string has an even number of `0`s.

- **Q**: \{q₀, q₁, q_{accept}, q_{reject}\}
- **\(\Sigma\)**: \{0, 1\}
- **\(\Gamma\)**: \{0, 1, ␣\}
- **\(\delta\)**:
  - \( \delta(q₀, 0) = (q₁, 0, R) \)
  - \( \delta(q₀, 1) = (q₀, 1, R) \)
  - \( \delta(q₀, ␣) = (q_{accept}, ␣, R) \)
  - \( \delta(q₁, 0) = (q₀, 0, R) \)
  - \( \delta(q₁, 1) = (q₁, 1, R) \)
  - \( \delta(q₁, ␣) = (q_{reject}, ␣, R) \)
- **q₀**: Start state
- **q_{accept}**: Accepting state
- **q_{reject}**: Rejecting state

This TM accepts strings with an even number of `0`s and rejects those with an odd number.

## 2. Representation of Turing Machine

### **Formal Representation**

A Turing Machine is formally represented as:

\[ TM = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, q_{accept}, q_{reject}) \]

Each component plays a specific role in defining the machine's behavior and operations.

### **Graphical Representation**

TMs are often depicted using state transition diagrams, where:

- **States** are represented by circles.
- **Transitions** are labeled with the current symbol, the symbol to write, and the direction to move.
  
**Example Diagram:**

```
(q₀) --0/0,R--> (q₁)
(q₀) --1/1,R--> (q₀)
(q₀) --␣/␣,R--> (q_accept)
(q₁) --0/0,R--> (q₀)
(q₁) --1/1,R--> (q₁)
(q₁) --␣/␣,R--> (q_reject)
```

This diagram corresponds to the earlier example TM for even number of `0`s.

### **Tabular Representation**

Alternatively, TMs can be represented in tables listing all possible transitions.

| Current State | Read Symbol | Write Symbol | Move Direction | Next State |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|------------|
| q₀            | 0           | 0            | R              | q₁         |
| q₀            | 1           | 1            | R              | q₀         |
| q₀            | ␣           | ␣            | R              | q_accept   |
| q₁            | 0           | 0            | R              | q₀         |
| q₁            | 1           | 1            | R              | q₁         |
| q₁            | ␣           | ␣            | R              | q_reject   |

## 3. Design of Turing Machine

### **Steps to Design a Turing Machine**

1. **Define the Language**: Clearly specify the language \( L \) that the TM will decide or recognize.
2. **Identify States**: Determine the necessary states for processing the input.
3. **Specify the Tape Alphabet**: Include all symbols the TM will need to read and write, including the blank symbol.
4. **Formulate Transition Functions**: Define how the TM transitions between states based on the current symbol, what it writes, and the direction it moves.
5. **Determine Acceptance Criteria**: Decide whether the TM will accept by reaching an accepting state or by emptying the stack.
6. **Optimize**: Simplify the TM by reducing unnecessary states or transitions.

### **Example: Binary Addition**

Design a TM that adds two binary numbers separated by a `#`.

- **Input**: `1101#1011` (13 + 11 = 24)
- **Output**: `11000`

**Design Steps:**

1. **States**: Include states for reading the first number, the `#`, the second number, performing addition, handling carry-over, and writing the result.
2. **Tape Alphabet**: \{0, 1, #, X, Y, ␣\}
3. **Transitions**: Define transitions to:
   - Move to the right to find the `#`.
   - Move to the end of the second number.
   - Perform addition from right to left, handling carry-over.
   - Write the result and clean up the tape.
4. **Acceptance**: Reach the accepting state after writing the final sum.

## 4. Linear Bounded Automata

### **What is a Linear Bounded Automaton (LBA)?**

A **Linear Bounded Automaton (LBA)** is a restricted form of a Turing Machine where the tape is limited to a size linearly proportional to the length of the input string. This constraint makes LBAs less powerful than general Turing Machines but still capable of recognizing **context-sensitive languages**.

### **Formal Definition**

An LBA is defined as an 8-tuple:

\[ LBA = (Q, X, \Sigma, q_0, ML, MR, \delta, F) \]

where:

- **Q**: A finite set of states.
- **X**: The tape alphabet.
- **\(\Sigma\)**: The input alphabet (\(\Sigma \subseteq X\)).
- **q₀**: The initial state.
- **ML**: The left end marker.
- **MR**: The right end marker (\( MR \neq ML \)).
- **\(\delta\)**: The transition function, \( \delta: Q \times X \rightarrow Q \times X \times \{-1, 0, +1\} \), indicating state transitions, symbol writing, and head movement.
- **F**: A set of final (accepting) states.

### **Characteristics**

- **Bounded Tape**: The tape used by LBA is restricted to contain no more than \( c \times n \) cells, where \( n \) is the length of the input and \( c \) is a constant.
- **Non-Deterministic**: LBAs are typically non-deterministic, allowing multiple possible transitions for a given state and symbol.
- **Context-Sensitive Languages**: LBAs recognize exactly the class of context-sensitive languages.

### **Example**

Consider the language \( L = \{ a^n b^n c^n \mid n \geq 1 \} \), which is context-sensitive.

An LBA for this language would:

1. Verify that the number of `a`s, `b`s, and `c`s are equal.
2. Use the tape to mark processed symbols and ensure proper sequencing.
3. Enter an accepting state if the input string conforms to the pattern.

## 5. Languages and Automata

### **Types of Languages Recognized**

- **Turing Machines**: Recognize **recursively enumerable languages**, which include all languages that can be listed by an algorithm.
- **Linear Bounded Automata**: Recognize **context-sensitive languages**, a subset of recursively enumerable languages.
- **Pushdown Automata**: Recognize **context-free languages**.
- **Finite Automata**: Recognize **regular languages**.

### **Hierarchy of Languages**

The Chomsky hierarchy classifies languages based on their generative power:

1. **Type-0**: Recursively enumerable languages (Turing Machines).
2. **Type-1**: Context-sensitive languages (Linear Bounded Automata).
3. **Type-2**: Context-free languages (Context-Free Grammars and Pushdown Automata).
4. **Type-3**: Regular languages (Regular Expressions and Finite Automata).

### **Closure Properties**

Different classes of languages have different closure properties:

- **Regular Languages**: Closed under union, intersection, concatenation, and Kleene star.
- **Context-Free Languages**: Closed under union and concatenation but not intersection.
- **Context-Sensitive Languages**: Closed under all Boolean operations.
- **Recursively Enumerable Languages**: Closed under all operations, including complementation.

## 6. Type 0 Grammars

### **What are Type 0 Grammars?**

**Type 0 Grammars**, also known as **unrestricted grammars**, are the most general class in the Chomsky hierarchy. They have no restrictions on their production rules and are equivalent in power to Turing Machines, meaning they can generate any recursively enumerable language.

### **Formal Definition**

A Type 0 Grammar is defined as a 4-tuple:

\[ G = (V, \Sigma, R, S) \]

where:

- **V**: A finite set of variables (non-terminals).
- **\(\Sigma\)**: A finite set of terminal symbols (\(\Sigma \subseteq V\)).
- **R**: A finite set of production rules, with rules of the form \( \alpha \rightarrow \beta \), where \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are strings of symbols from \( V \cup \Sigma \). There's no restriction on \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \).
- **S**: The start symbol, \( S \in V \).

### **Characteristics**

- **Unrestricted Productions**: Production rules can have any combination of terminals and non-terminals on both sides.
- **Expressive Power**: Capable of generating all languages that are recursively enumerable.
- **Equivalence to Turing Machines**: Any language that can be recognized by a Turing Machine can be generated by a Type 0 Grammar and vice versa.

### **Example**

Consider the following Type 0 Grammar:

\[
\begin{align*}
S &\rightarrow AB \\
A &\rightarrow aA \\
A &\rightarrow a \\
B &\rightarrow bB \\
B &\rightarrow b \\
\end{align*}
\]

This grammar generates the language \( L = \{ a^n b^n \mid n \geq 1 \} \), which is context-sensitive and can also be recognized by an LBA.

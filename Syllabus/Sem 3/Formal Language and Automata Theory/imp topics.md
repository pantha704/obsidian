### Example Questions from PYQs

- Convert the given NFA to its equivalent DFA.
- Prove that the language \( L = \{a^n b^n | n \geq 1\} \) is not regular using the pumping lemma.
- Draw a DFA for the language accepting strings with specific patterns (e.g., each 'a' is immediately preceded and followed by 'b').
- Define ambiguous grammar and identify whether a given grammar is ambiguous.
- Construct a PDA that recognizes strings with equal numbers of 0's and 1's.

By practicing these specific questions, you'll be better prepared for similar questions on your exam.

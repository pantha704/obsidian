## 1. Pumping Lemma & Its Application

### **Pumping Lemma for Regular Languages**

The **Pumping Lemma** is a fundamental property used to prove that certain languages are **not regular**. It provides a necessary condition that all regular languages must satisfy.

#### **Statement of the Pumping Lemma:**

If \( L \) is a regular language, then there exists a pumping length \( p \) (a positive integer) such that any string \( s \) in \( L \) with length at least \( p \) can be divided into three parts, \( s = xyz \), satisfying the following conditions:

1. **Length Constraint**: \( |xy| \leq p \)
2. **Non-Empty Middle**: \( |y| \geq 1 \)
3. **Pumping Condition**: For all \( i \geq 0 \), the string \( xy^iz \) is in \( L \)

#### **Application of the Pumping Lemma:**

The Pumping Lemma is primarily used to show that a language is **not regular** by demonstrating that it does not satisfy the conditions of the lemma.

#### **Steps to Use the Pumping Lemma:**

1. **Assume** the language \( L \) is regular.
2. **Obtain** the pumping length \( p \) from the lemma.
3. **Choose** a specific string \( s \) in \( L \) such that \( |s| \geq p \).
4. **Divide** \( s \) into \( xyz \) where \( |xy| \leq p \) and \( |y| \geq 1 \).
5. **Pumping Down (i = 0)**: Show that \( xy^0z = xz \) is **not** in \( L \), leading to a contradiction.
6. **Conclude** that \( L \) is **not regular**.

#### **Example:**

**Language**: \( L = \{ a^n b^n \mid n \geq 0 \} \)

**Proof by Pumping Lemma**:

1. Assume \( L \) is regular.
2. Let \( p \) be the pumping length.
3. Choose \( s = a^p b^p \) where \( |s| = 2p \geq p \).
4. Divide \( s \) into \( xyz \) where \( |xy| \leq p \) and \( |y| \geq 1 \). Thus, \( y \) consists only of \( a \)'s.
5. Pumping down: \( xy^0z = xz = a^{p - |y|} b^p \).
6. \( xz \) has fewer \( a \)'s than \( b \)'s, so \( xz \notin L \).
7. Contradiction implies \( L \) is **not regular**.

## 2. Closure Properties

### **Definition**

**Closure Properties** describe the operations under which regular languages remain regular. Regular languages are **closed** under various operations, meaning applying these operations to regular languages results in another regular language.

### **Common Closure Properties of Regular Languages**

1. **Union**:
   - **Definition**: If \( L_1 \) and \( L_2 \) are regular, then \( L_1 \cup L_2 \) is regular.
   - **Construction**: Use the union construction method with finite automata.

2. **Concatenation**:
   - **Definition**: If \( L_1 \) and \( L_2 \) are regular, then \( L_1 \cdot L_2 \) is regular.
   - **Construction**: Connect the automaton of \( L_1 \) to that of \( L_2 \).

3. **Kleene Star**:
   - **Definition**: If \( L \) is regular, then \( L^* \) is regular.
   - **Construction**: Add ε-transitions to allow repeated concatenation.

4. **Intersection**:
   - **Definition**: If \( L_1 \) and \( L_2 \) are regular, then \( L_1 \cap L_2 \) is regular.
   - **Construction**: Use the product automaton approach.

5. **Complement**:
   - **Definition**: If \( L \) is regular, then its complement \( \overline{L} \) is regular.
   - **Construction**: Swap the accepting and non-accepting states in the DFA of \( L \).

6. **Difference**:
   - **Definition**: If \( L_1 \) and \( L_2 \) are regular, then \( L_1 - L_2 \) is regular.
   - **Construction**: Use the complement and intersection properties.

7. **Reverse**:
   - **Definition**: If \( L \) is regular, then its reverse \( L^R \) is regular.
   - **Construction**: Reverse the automaton and adjust the start and accept states.

8. **Homomorphism**:
   - **Definition**: Applying a homomorphism to a regular language results in a regular language.
   - **Construction**: Replace each symbol in the regular expression according to the homomorphism.

9. **Inverse Homomorphism**:
   - **Definition**: The inverse homomorphism of a regular language is regular.
   - **Construction**: Pre-image mapping using automaton transformations.

## 3. Minimization of Finite Automata

### **Purpose**

Minimizing a finite automaton involves reducing the number of states in a DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) without changing the language it recognizes. A minimized DFA is optimal in terms of state count.

### **Steps for Minimization:**

1. **Remove Unreachable States**:
   - **Definition**: States that cannot be reached from the initial state.
   - **Procedure**: Perform a reachability analysis and eliminate unreachable states.

2. **Merge Equivalent States**:
   - **Definition**: States that cannot be distinguished by any string of inputs.
   - **Procedure**: Identify and merge equivalent states using partitioning methods.

### **Algorithms for Minimization:**

1. **Table-Filling Algorithm**:
   - **Procedure**:
     1. Create a table listing all state pairs.
     2. Mark pairs where one is accepting and the other is not.
     3. Iteratively mark pairs where transitions lead to marked pairs.
     4. Unmarked pairs are equivalent and can be merged.

2. **Hopcroft’s Algorithm**:
   - **Procedure**:
     1. Start with all accepting and non-accepting states as separate partitions.
     2. Split partitions based on distinguishable transitions.
     3. Continue until no further splits are possible.
     4. Merge states within the same partition.

### **Example:**

Consider a DFA with states that can be grouped into equivalent classes based on their behavior for all possible inputs. By applying the table-filling algorithm, equivalent states are identified and merged, resulting in a minimized DFA.

## 4. Minimization by Distinguishable Pair, Myhill-Nerode Theorem

### **Minimization by Distinguishable Pairs**

This method involves identifying pairs of states that are distinguishable (i.e., there exists some string that can differentiate their behavior) and merging indistinguishable states.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Initialize** all pairs of states.
2. **Mark** pairs where one is accepting and the other is not.
3. **Iterate** through the table, marking pairs where transitions lead to already marked pairs.
4. **Merge** all unmarked (indistinguishable) pairs.

### **Myhill-Nerode Theorem**

The **Myhill-Nerode Theorem** provides a characterization of regular languages in terms of equivalence relations and is fundamental to automata theory.

#### **Statement:**

A language \( L \) is regular if and only if it has a **finite number of equivalence classes** under the relation \( \equiv_L \), where for any two strings \( x \) and \( y \):

\[ x \equiv_L y \iff \forall z \in \Sigma^*, \, xz \in L \iff yz \in L \]

#### **Implications:**

- **Equivalence Classes**: Each class represents a set of strings that cannot be distinguished by any continuation with strings \( z \).
- **State Minimization**: The number of equivalence classes corresponds to the number of states in the minimal DFA for \( L \).

#### **Procedure Using Myhill-Nerode:**

1. **Define** the equivalence relation \( \equiv_L \).
2. **Determine** the equivalence classes.
3. **Construct** the minimal DFA with states representing each equivalence class.

### **Example:**

For the language \( L = \{ a^n b^n \mid n \geq 0 \} \):

1. Assume \( L \) is regular (which it is not).
2. Attempting to define equivalence classes leads to an infinite number, violating the theorem.
3. Hence, \( L \) is **not regular**.

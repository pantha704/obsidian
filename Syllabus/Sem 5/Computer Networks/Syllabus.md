### **Module-I: Introduction to Data Communication [4L]**
*   **Core Concepts:**
    *   **OSI Model (7 Layers):** Imagine sending a letter. *Physical* (Truck/Road), *Data Link* (Local Post Office sorting), *Network* (Addressing/Zip codes), *Transport* (Guaranteed Delivery/Certified Mail), *Session* (Phone call setup), *Presentation* (Translation), *Application* (Actual Email Program).
    *   **TCP/IP Suite (4/5 Layers):** Practical implementation. *Link* (OSI Data Link + Physical), *Internet* (OSI Network - IP), *Transport* (TCP/UDP), *Application* (OSI Session+Pres+App - HTTP, FTP, SMTP).
    *   **Protocols & Standards:** Rules for communication (like grammar). Standards ensure compatibility (like USB ports).
    *   **Addressing:** Identifies devices (Logical/IP) or hardware (Physical/MAC).
*   **Key Comparison:**
    *   **OSI vs. TCP/IP:** OSI is a *reference model* (theoretical framework), TCP/IP is the *practical suite* used on the internet. TCP/IP combines OSI's top 3 layers into "Application".
*   **Exam Focus:** Understand layer functions & responsibilities. Map protocols to layers (e.g., HTTP->App, IP->Network, Ethernet->Data Link). Know logical vs. physical addressing. *Common Qs:* "Which layer handles routing?", "What's the difference between OSI Network layer and TCP/IP Internet layer?"
*   **Essential Resources:**
    1.  **YouTube:** "OSI Model Explained" by PowerCert Animated Videos (<10 mins)
    2.  **Cheat Sheet:** TutorialsPoint "Computer Network Quick Guide" (OSI/TCP/IP section)
    3.  **Interactive:** "OSI Model Interactive" online quizzes (search for one).

### **Module-III: Data Link Layer & MAC Sublayer [12L]**
*   **Core Concepts:**
    *   **Error Detection/Correction:**
        *   **CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check):** Most common detection. Sender calculates remainder, appends it. Receiver recalculates; mismatch = error. *(Exam Focus: Understand process, polynomial division concept)*.
        *   **Hamming Distance:** Minimum # bit flips to change one valid code to another. Determines detection/correction capability (e.g., Hamming Distance 3 detects 2 errors, corrects 1).
    *   **Flow & Error Control Protocols:**
        *   **Stop-and-Wait:** Send 1 frame, wait for ACK. Simple, inefficient.
        *   **Go-Back-N:** Send N frames; if error, resend ALL from lost frame. Efficient pipeline, wastes bandwidth on error.
        *   **Selective Repeat:** Send N frames; resend ONLY lost/damaged frames. Most efficient, complex receiver.
        *   **Sliding Window:** Mechanism allowing multiple frames "in flight" (Go-Back-N & Selective Repeat use this).
    *   **MAC Protocols (Accessing Shared Media):**
        *   **ALOHA/Pure ALOHA:** Shout whenever ready. Collisions likely.
        *   **Slotted ALOHA:** Shout only at slot starts. Reduces collisions.
        *   **CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection):** Listen before talk (Carrier Sense), Listen while talking (Collision Detection - *Ethernet*). If collision, stop & retry later.
        *   **CSMA/CA (Collision Avoidance):** Used where detection is hard (Wireless/WiFi). Uses RTS/CTS handshaking and random waits to *avoid* collisions.
    *   **LANs:** Ethernet (Wired, uses CSMA/CD), WiFi (Wireless, uses CSMA/CA), VLANs (Logical segmentation of physical LAN).
*   **Key Comparisons:**
    *   **Error Control Protocols:**
        | Protocol          | Efficiency | Bandwidth Usage on Error | Receiver Complexity |
        |-------------------|------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
        | Stop-and-Wait     | Low        | Low                      | Low                |
        | Go-Back-N         | Medium     | High (Resends good)      | Medium             |
        | Selective Repeat  | High       | Low (Resends only bad)   | High               |
    *   **CSMA/CD vs. CSMA/CA:**
        | Feature       | CSMA/CD          | CSMA/CA           |
        |---------------|------------------|-------------------|

        | Usage         | Wired (Ethernet) | Wireless (WiFi)  |
        | Mechanism     | Listen while Tx  | RTS/CTS + Backoff |
*   **Protocols:**
    *   **HDLC:** Bit-oriented synchronous framing protocol (point-to-point/WANs). Uses flags, bit stuffing.
    *   **Ethernet:** Dominant wired LAN standard (IEEE 802.3). Defines physical media, framing, MAC (CSMA/CD for half-duplex).
*   **Exam Focus:** *High Yield!* CRC calculation steps/logic. Sliding window operation (sender/receiver windows). Differences between Go-Back-N & Selective Repeat. *Crucial:* Purpose & use of CSMA/CD vs CSMA/CA. Basic Ethernet frame structure. *Common Qs:* "Calculate CRC given data/poly", "Window size for Selective Repeat?", "Why CSMA/CA, not CD, in WiFi?"

        *   **IPv6:** 128-bit address (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334). Solves IPv4 exhaustion. Simpler header, built-in security (IPsec optional), no NAT needed. *DHCPv6* for auto-configuration.
    *   **Routing Protocols:**
        *   **RIP (Routing Information Protocol):** Distance Vector. Hops = metric. Slow convergence, max 15 hops. Simple. "How many stops?"
        *   **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):** Link State. Routers know entire topology. Uses Dijkstra's algorithm. Fast convergence. "Knows the map."
        *   **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):** Path Vector. Used *between* Autonomous Systems (ISPs). Policy-based routing. "Inter-domain routing for the internet."
    *   **Forwarding:** Moving packets within a router (based on routing table).
    *   **Delivery:** Sending packets to the next hop or final destination.

### **Module-V: Transport Layer [6L]**
*   **Core Concepts:**
    *   **Process-to-Process:** Delivers data to the correct *application* (port numbers identify processes).
    *   **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** Connectionless, unreliable, fast. No setup, no ACKs, no flow/error control (app must handle). Good for DNS, VoIP, streaming. "Best effort postcard."
    *   **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Connection-oriented, reliable, ordered, flow/error controlled. Uses 3-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK), acknowledgements (ACKs), sliding window. Good for HTTP, FTP, email. "Registered mail with tracking."
    *   **QoS (Quality of Service):** Managing traffic to prioritize critical data (e.g., VoIP over file download).
        *   **Leaky Bucket:** Smooths bursty traffic. Packets leave at constant rate (like water leaking). Drops packets if bucket full. Controls *rate*.
        *   **Token Bucket:** Allows bursts up to a limit. Tokens added at rate; packet needs token to send. Saves tokens for bursts. Controls *average rate + burst size*.
*   **Key Comparisons:**
    *   **TCP vs UDP:**
        | Feature         | TCP                      | UDP                          |

**Final Revision Tips:**
1.  **Focus on Comparisons:** Tables are your friend (OSI/TCP/IP, IPv4/IPv6, Circuit/Packet, TCP/UDP, RIP/OSPF/BGP, Leaky/Token).
2.  **Master Key Concepts:** OSI Layers, CRC logic, Sliding Window, CSMA/CD vs CA, Subnetting, TCP Handshake & Features, QoS goals.
3.  **Practice Calculations:** Subnetting, *understanding* CRC (if required for exam).
4.  **Protocol Purpose:** Always ask *"What problem does this solve?"* (e.g., ARP = find MAC, DHCP = get IP, TCP = reliable stream).
5.  **Use Resources Wisely:** Watch short videos for tough concepts. Use cheat sheets for quick lookups. Do practice questions!

**Good Luck! You've got this!**

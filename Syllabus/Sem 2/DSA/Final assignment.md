# Study Guide: Algorithms and Data Structures

## 1. AVL Trees
### Definition
- **AVL Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree where the difference in heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes.

### Construction Example
For the data sequence: 21, 26, 30, 9, 4, 14, 28, 18, 15, 10, 2, 3, 7.
1. **Insert 21, 26, 30**: Balancing required after each insertion.
2. **Insert 9**: No imbalance.
3. **Insert 4**: Balances after reorganization.
4. Continue similarly for all elements ensuring the AVL property is maintained after each insertion.

## 2. Quick Sort
### Algorithm
1. Choose a pivot element.
2. Partition the array: elements less than pivot to the left, greater to the right.
3. Recursively apply Quick Sort to the partitions.

### Worst-case Scenario
Occurs when pivot selection consistently results in highly unbalanced partitions, such as when the array is already sorted, leading to O(nÂ²) time complexity.

## 3. Min Heap
### Definition
A complete binary tree where each node is smaller than its children.

### Creation Example
For data: 23, 12, 21, 15, 14, 50, 13.
1. Insert each element and maintain the heap property by swapping as necessary.

### Algorithm: Heap Sort
1. Build a max heap from the input data.
2. Swap the root with the last element, reduce heap size, and heapify the root.
3. Repeat until the heap is sorted.

## 4. Binary Search Tree (BST)
### Definition
A tree where each node has at most two children, left child < parent, right child > parent.

### Successor in BST
The node with the smallest value greater than a given node, typically found by going to the right child and then all the way left.

## 5. Linked List Operations
### Insertion into Sorted Linked List
- Traverse to find the correct position and insert.

### Deletion from Sorted Linked List
- Traverse to find the node and adjust pointers to remove it.

## 6. Hash Tables
### Definition
A data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function.

### Collision Resolution
- **Linear Probing**: Check the next slot.
- **Quadratic Probing**: Use a quadratic function to find the next slot.

## 7. Postfix Expression Evaluation
Convert postfix to infix by following the operations from left to right, using a stack to store operands.

## 8. Circular Queue
### Definition
A queue where the last position is connected back to the first, forming a circle.

### Advantages
Efficient use of space by reusing vacant spots freed by dequeue operations.

## 9. Prefix to Infix Conversion
Convert prefix expressions to infix by reversing the order and applying the operations in the correct order of precedence using a stack.

## 10. Linked Lists
### Singly Linked List
Nodes have data and a reference to the next node.

### Doubly Linked List
Nodes have data and references to both the next and previous nodes, allowing traversal in both directions.

## 11. Merge Sort
### Algorithm
1. Divide the array into two halves.
2. Recursively sort each half.
3. Merge the sorted halves.

### Complexity
- Best, Worst, and Average Case: O(n log n).

## 12. Tree Traversals
### In-Order
Left, Root, Right
### Pre-Order
Root, Left, Right
### Post-Order
Left, Right, Root

## 13. Graph Algorithms
### Depth-First Search (DFS)
Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
### Dijkstra's Algorithm
Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.

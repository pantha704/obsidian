Alright, let's go through the topics one by one based on the image you provided. 

### Matter Waves & Uncertainty Principle

1. **State de Broglie hypothesis (8.2):**
   - The de Broglie hypothesis proposes that particles such as electrons can exhibit wave-like behavior. The wavelength (\(\lambda\)) of a particle is given by \(\lambda = \frac{h}{p}\), where \(h\) is Planck's constant and \(p\) is the momentum of the particle.

2. **State the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (3.5):**
   - The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and exact momentum of a particle. Mathematically, it is expressed as \(\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{h}{4\pi}\), where \(\Delta x\) is the uncertainty in position and \(\Delta p\) is the uncertainty in momentum.

3. **Write some properties of the matter waves (3.2.3):**
   - Matter waves are associated with particles.
   - They have wavelengths given by de Broglie’s relation.
   - The wave nature of particles is evident in phenomena such as diffraction and interference.
   - The amplitude of matter waves is related to the probability density of finding the particle at a particular location.

### Schrödinger Theory and its Applications

1. **Write down the time-dependent and time-independent Schrödinger equation:**
   - Time-dependent Schrödinger equation: \(i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi(\mathbf{r}, t)}{\partial t} = \hat{H} \Psi(\mathbf{r}, t)\)
   - Time-independent Schrödinger equation: \(\hat{H} \psi(\mathbf{r}) = E \psi(\mathbf{r})\), where \(\hat{H}\) is the Hamiltonian operator.

2. **Consider a particle in an infinite square well. Solve the Schrödinger equation to find its eigenfunction and eigenvalues:**
   - For a particle in an infinite potential well of width \(a\), the eigenfunctions are \(\psi_n(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{a}} \sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{a}\right)\) and the eigenvalues are \(E_n = \frac{n^2 h^2}{8ma^2}\), where \(n\) is a positive integer, \(m\) is the mass of the particle, and \(h\) is Planck's constant.

3. **Plot the energy bands and normalized wave functions for ground state and other excited states:**
   - The ground state is the lowest energy state (n=1), with the energy \(E_1\). The first excited state is for \(n=2\), and so on. The wave functions \(\psi_n(x)\) for different \(n\) have more nodes as \(n\) increases.

4. **Prove that the wave function \(\Psi(x, t) = A\cos(kx - \omega t)\) does not satisfy the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for a free particle:**
   - Substituting \(\Psi(x, t)\) into the time-dependent Schrödinger equation and showing the inconsistency in satisfying both sides of the equation reveals that \(\Psi(x, t) = A\cos(kx - \omega t)\) does not satisfy the equation.

### Crystallography

1. **Compare crystalline material and amorphous material with example (9.2.1+9.2.2):**
   - Crystalline materials have a well-ordered, repeating atomic structure (e.g., diamond). Amorphous materials lack this long-range order (e.g., glass).

2. **Compare primitive cell and unit cell with diagram (9.3.5):**
   - A primitive cell is the smallest repeating unit in a crystal lattice that, when repeated, creates the entire lattice. A unit cell is a volume that encompasses the entire symmetry of the crystal lattice, which can be made up of one or more primitive cells.

3. **What do you mean by Bravais lattice (9.4.1):**
   - A Bravais lattice is an infinite array of discrete points in three-dimensional space generated by a set of discrete translation operations described by \(\mathbf{R} = n_1 \mathbf{a}_1 + n_2 \mathbf{a}_2 + n_3 \mathbf{a}_3\), where \(n_i\) are integers and \(\mathbf{a}_i\) are the primitive vectors.

4. **How many Bravais lattices are there in three dimensions?:**
   - There are 14 distinct Bravais lattices in three-dimensional space.

5. **State the name of the seven crystal systems:**
   - Cubic, Tetragonal, Orthorhombic, Hexagonal, Trigonal, Monoclinic, and Triclinic.

6. **Calculate the interplanar spacing of planes in a simple cubic lattice of side ‘a’ (9.7):**
   - For a simple cubic lattice, the interplanar spacing \(d\) between planes with Miller indices (hkl) is given by \(d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}}\).

7. **Define coordination number (9.8.2):**
   - The coordination number is the number of nearest neighbors surrounding an atom or ion in a crystal structure.

8. **Define atomic packing factor (9.8.3):**
   - The atomic packing factor (APF) is the fraction of volume in a crystal structure that is occupied by atoms. For example, APF for a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure is \(\frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{2}}\).

9. **Find the relation between the side of the BCC, FCC, SC unit cell with the radius of atom (9.8.1):**
   - Simple Cubic (SC): \(a = 2r\)
   - Body-Centered Cubic (BCC): \(a = \frac{4r}{\sqrt{3}}\)
   - Face-Centered Cubic (FCC): \(a = \frac{4r}{\sqrt{2}}\)

10. **Discuss about the atomic positions, coordination number, atoms per unit cell and atomic packing factor of SC, BCC and FCC crystal with diagram:**
    - Simple Cubic (SC):
      - Atomic positions: (0,0,0)
      - Coordination number: 6
      - Atoms per unit cell: 1
      - APF: 0.52
    - Body-Centered Cubic (BCC):
      - Atomic positions: (0,0,0) and \(\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}\right)\)
      - Coordination number: 8
      - Atoms per unit cell: 2
      - APF: 0.68
    - Face-Centered Cubic (FCC):
      - Atomic positions: (0,0,0), \(\left(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2},0\right)\), \(\left(\frac{1}{2},0,\frac{1}{2}\right)\), \(\left(0,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}\right)\)
      - Coordination number: 12
      - Atoms per unit cell: 4
      - APF: 0.74

11. **Write the interplanar spacing between consecutive parallel planes of Miller indices (hkl) (9.7):**
    - The interplanar spacing \(d_{hkl}\) in a crystal lattice is given by \(d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}}\).

12. **Consider a crystal lattice, a = b = 4.5 Å, and c = 2.8 Å. Calculate the distance between adjacent planes with Miller indices (0, 1, 2):**
    - For a triclinic crystal with given lattice parameters, the distance \(d\) between planes with Miller indices (hkl) can be calculated using the general formula for triclinic systems. 

### Semiconductor Physics

1. **Draw energy band diagram for semiconductor (extrinsic & intrinsic) (10.4.1+10.4.2):**
   - Intrinsic semiconductor: Shows the valence band, conduction band, and intrinsic Fermi level \(E_i\).
   - Extrinsic semiconductor: Shows the valence band, conduction band, donor/acceptor levels, and the shifted Fermi level for n-type and p-type semiconductors.

2. **Discuss about the formation of n-type and p-type semiconductor (10.2.1):**
   - N-type: Formed by doping an intrinsic semiconductor with pentavalent impurities, providing extra electrons.
   - P-type: Formed by doping with trivalent impurities, creating holes.

3. **What is majority carrier and minority carrier for n-type and p-type semiconductor?:**
   - N-type: Majority carriers are electrons, minority carriers are holes.
   - P-type: Majority carriers are holes, minority carriers are electrons.

4. **Discuss about the formation of depletion layer with diagram:**
   - The depletion layer forms at the junction of p-type and n-type materials, where electrons and holes recombine, leaving behind charged ions and creating an electric field.

#### 5. Discuss about the formation of the depletion layer with diagram.

**Depletion Layer Formation:**
- When a p-type semiconductor (which has an abundance of holes) is brought into contact with an n-type semiconductor (which has an abundance of electrons), a p-n junction is formed.
- At the junction, electrons from the n-type region diffuse into the p-type region and recombine with holes, while holes from the p-type region diffuse into the n-type region and recombine with electrons.
- This diffusion of carriers leads to a region around the junction where there are no free charge carriers, known as the depletion region or depletion layer.
- The depletion region is characterized by the presence of immobile ionized donor and acceptor atoms, resulting in an electric field that opposes further diffusion of charge carriers.
- The electric field creates a potential barrier that must be overcome for charge carriers to move across the junction.

**Diagram:**

#### 6. Sketch the diagram for a forward-biased and reverse-biased p-n junction.

**Forward-Biased p-n Junction:**
- In forward bias, the p-type is connected to the positive terminal of the battery, and the n-type is connected to the negative terminal.
- This reduces the width of the depletion region and allows current to flow.

```
  p-type                  n-type
  ---------     |     Depletion Region     |   ---------
|    -         |      |                   |  -           |
|   - -        |      |                   | - -           |
|  - - -       | <--- |++++++ <---        | - - -         |
|   - -        |      |++++++             | - -           |

  ---------     |     |++++               |   ---------
```

**Reverse-Biased p-n Junction:**
- In reverse bias, the p-type is connected to the negative terminal of the battery, and the n-type is connected to the positive terminal.
- This increases the width of the depletion region and prevents current from flowing, except for a small leakage current.

```
  p-type                  n-type
  ---------     |     Depletion Region     |   ---------

#### 7. Differentiate between conductor, insulator, and semiconductor in terms of band gap.

**Band Gap:**
- The energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band in a material.

**Conductors:**
- Have overlapping valence and conduction bands or a very small band gap.
- Electrons can move freely, allowing easy flow of current.
- Examples: Metals like copper, aluminum.

**Insulators:**
- Have a large band gap (typically > 3 eV).
- Very few electrons can jump from the valence band to the conduction band, hence they do not conduct electricity well.
- Examples: Glass, rubber.

**Semiconductors:**
- Have a moderate band gap (typically < 3 eV).
- At absolute zero, they behave as insulators, but at higher temperatures, thermal energy allows electrons to jump to the conduction band, enabling conductivity.
- Examples: Silicon, germanium.

#### 8. Discuss the behavior of n-type and p-type semiconductors with respect to the majority and minority carriers.

**n-type Semiconductor:**
- Doped with elements that have more valence electrons than the semiconductor material (e.g., phosphorus in silicon).
- **Majority Carriers:** Electrons (from the donor atoms).
- **Minority Carriers:** Holes (generated by thermal excitation).

**p-type Semiconductor:**
- Doped with elements that have fewer valence electrons than the semiconductor material (e.g., boron in silicon).
- **Majority Carriers:** Holes (from the acceptor atoms).
- **Minority Carriers:** Electrons (generated by thermal excitation).

**Behavior:**
- In an n-type semiconductor, conduction is mainly due to the movement of electrons.
- In a p-type semiconductor, conduction is mainly due to the movement of holes.
- The minority carriers play a crucial role in processes like recombination and in the operation of devices such as transistors and diodes.

#### 9. Draw energy band diagrams for (i) forward-biased and (ii) reverse-biased p-n junctions.

**Forward-Biased p-n Junction Energy Band Diagram:**
- The energy bands bend downward on the p-side and upward on the n-side, reducing the barrier and allowing current to flow.

**Reverse-Biased p-n Junction Energy Band Diagram:**

Let's break down the topics shown in the second image to help you prepare for your exam:

### Quantum Mechanics and Black Body Radiation

#### 1. Define Blackbody (2.3.2)
A **blackbody** is an idealized physical body that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation, regardless of frequency or angle of incidence. It is a perfect absorber and emitter of radiation.

#### 2. Show Graphically How the Energy Density Versus Frequency (or Wavelength) Plot of Blackbody Radiations is Changed if the Temperature is Increased (Fig 3)
As the temperature increases, the peak of the blackbody radiation curve shifts to higher frequencies (or shorter wavelengths), and the overall emitted energy increases. This is illustrated in the given graph where \( T_1 > T_2 > T_3 \).

- **Graph Explanation**:
  - At higher temperatures, the peak wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} \)) shifts to shorter wavelengths.
  - The area under the curve increases, indicating higher total emitted energy.

#### 3. Discuss the Important Conclusions That Can Be Drawn from the Above Energy Density vs Wavelength Curve at Different Temperatures (2.4)
- **Wien's Displacement Law**: As temperature increases, the peak wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{max}} \)) decreases, implying \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \) is inversely proportional to temperature (\( T \)).
- **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The total energy radiated per unit surface area of a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature (\( E \propto T^4 \)).
- **Planck's Law**: Describes the distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a blackbody in thermal equilibrium.

#### 4. State Wien's Radiation Formula and Discuss Its Limitations with Diagram (2.5.1)
- **Wien's Radiation Formula**: \( E(\lambda, T) = \frac{a}{\lambda^5} e^{-b/\lambda T} \)
  - \( E(\lambda, T) \): Energy density.
  - \( \lambda \): Wavelength.
  - \( T \): Absolute temperature.
  - \( a \) and \( b \): Constants.
				- **Limitations**: Accurate only at shorter wavelengths (high frequencies); fails at longer wavelengths (low frequencies), where Rayleigh-Jeans law is more accurate.

#### 5. Derive Rayleigh-Jean's Law from Planck's Radiation Law (2.6.3)
- **Planck's Radiation Law**: \( E(\lambda, T) = \frac{8\pi h c}{\lambda^5} \frac{1}{e^{hc/\lambda kT} - 1} \)
- **Rayleigh-Jeans Approximation** (for long wavelengths or low frequencies):
  - \( E(\lambda, T) \approx \frac{8\pi kT}{\lambda^4} \)

#### 6. Derive Wien's Radiation Law from Planck's Radiation Law (2.6.1)
- **Planck's Law**: Simplifies to Wien's Law at short wavelengths (high frequencies).
  - \( E(\lambda, T) \approx \frac{8\pi h c}{\lambda^5} e^{-hc/\lambda kT} \)

### Matter Waves & Uncertainty Principle

#### 1. Properties of Matter Waves
- **Wave-Particle Duality**: Particles like electrons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.
- **Wavelength**: Given by de Broglie hypothesis (\( \lambda = \frac{h}{p} \)), where \( h \) is Planck's constant and \( p \) is the momentum.
- **Interference and Diffraction**: Matter waves can interfere and diffract, similar to light waves.

#### 2. State the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
The **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle** states that it is impossible to simultaneously know both the exact position and exact momentum of a particle. Mathematically:
\[ \Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{h}{4\pi} \]
where \( \Delta x \) is the uncertainty in position and \( \Delta p \) is the uncertainty in momentum.

#### 3. State de Broglie Hypothesis
The **de Broglie Hypothesis** proposes that any moving particle or object has an associated wave. The wavelength \( \lambda \) of this wave is given by:
\[ \lambda = \frac{h}{p} \]
where \( h \) is Planck's constant and \( p \) is the momentum of the particle.

With these explanations and derivations, you should be well-prepared to tackle these topics in your exam. Good luck!

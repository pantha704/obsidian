Certainly! Let's go through the topics listed in your image and explain each one.

### Forced Vibration

1. **What is forced vibration?**
   - Forced vibration occurs when an external force drives a system to oscillate at its own frequency. Unlike free vibrations, which occur naturally when a system is disturbed and then left to oscillate on its own, forced vibrations are sustained by continuous or repeated external forces.

2. **Write the differential equation of forced vibration and explain the significance of each term in the equation.**
   - The differential equation for forced vibration is:
     \[ m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + c\frac{dx}{dt} + kx = F(t) \]
     where:
     - \( m \) is the mass of the system,
     - \( \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} \) is the acceleration,
     - \( c \) is the damping coefficient,
     - \( \frac{dx}{dt} \) is the velocity,
     - \( k \) is the stiffness of the system,
     - \( x \) is the displacement, and
     - \( F(t) \) is the external force as a function of time.

3. **Define amplitude resonance.**
   - Amplitude resonance occurs when the frequency of the external force matches the natural frequency of the system, resulting in a significant increase in the amplitude of oscillations.

4. **Define velocity resonance.**
   - Velocity resonance happens when the external force causes the velocity of the system to oscillate at its maximum possible amplitude.

5. **Establish the condition for velocity resonance. (6.3.2)**
   - The condition for velocity resonance is typically when the damping is such that the system oscillates at a frequency where the velocity response is maximized, usually at or near the system's natural frequency in the presence of damping.

6. **Establish the condition for amplitude resonance. (6.3.1)**
   - Amplitude resonance condition is met when the driving frequency equals the natural frequency of the undamped system, i.e., \( \omega_{d} = \omega_{n} \).

7. **Define steady state in case of forced vibration.**
   - In forced vibration, the steady state is the condition where the system's response (displacement, velocity, etc.) remains constant over time despite the continuous external force, as transient effects die out.

8. **Write down the expression for amplitude of a forced oscillator in the steady state.**
   - The steady-state amplitude \( X \) of a forced oscillator is given by:
     \[ X = \frac{F_0}{\sqrt{(k - m\omega^2)^2 + (c\omega)^2}} \]
     where \( F_0 \) is the amplitude of the driving force, and \( \omega \) is the angular frequency of the driving force.

### Black Body Radiation

1. **Define Blackbody (2.3.2).**
   - A blackbody is an idealized physical body that absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation, regardless of frequency or angle of incidence. It also emits radiation in a characteristic, continuous spectrum that depends only on its temperature.

2. **State Wien’s radiation formula and discuss its limitations with a diagram. (2.5.1)**
   - Wien's radiation law describes the distribution of thermal radiation intensity as a function of wavelength for a blackbody at a given temperature. The formula is:
     \[ I(\lambda, T) = \frac{c_1}{\lambda^5} e^{-c_2 / (\lambda T)} \]
     where \( c_1 \) and \( c_2 \) are constants, \( \lambda \) is the wavelength, and \( T \) is the temperature.
     - Limitations: Wien's law is accurate for short wavelengths (high frequencies) but fails at longer wavelengths.

3. **State Rayleigh-Jeans law and discuss its limitations with a diagram. (2.5.3)**
   - Rayleigh-Jeans law describes the intensity of radiation emitted by a blackbody at a given wavelength. The formula is:
     \[ I(\lambda, T) = \frac{2ck_B T}{\lambda^4} \]
     where \( c \) is the speed of light, \( k_B \) is the Boltzmann constant, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength.
     - Limitations: It predicts infinite energy at short wavelengths, leading to the "ultraviolet catastrophe."

4. **State Planck’s law of radiation.**
   - Planck’s law provides a formula for the intensity of radiation emitted by a blackbody in thermal equilibrium at a given temperature:
     \[ I(\lambda, T) = \frac{2hc^2}{\lambda^5} \frac{1}{e^{hc / (\lambda k_B T)} - 1} \]
     where \( h \) is Planck’s constant, \( c \) is the speed of light, \( k_B \) is the Boltzmann constant, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength.

5. **Derive Wien’s radiation law from Planck’s radiation law. (2.6.1)**
   - Wien's law can be derived from Planck's law in the high-frequency (short-wavelength) limit where \( hc / (\lambda k_B T) \gg 1 \). In this limit, the exponential term \( e^{hc / (\lambda k_B T)} \) dominates, and Planck’s law simplifies to Wien's approximation.

6. **What is ultraviolet catastrophe?**
   - The ultraviolet catastrophe refers to the classical prediction that an ideal blackbody at thermal equilibrium will emit infinite energy as the wavelength of emitted radiation approaches zero. This prediction arises from the Rayleigh-Jeans law and was later resolved by Planck’s quantum theory.

7. **Show graphically, how the energy density versus wavelength plot of blackbody radiations is changed if the temperature is increased.**
   - As temperature increases, the peak of the blackbody radiation curve shifts to shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies), and the total emitted energy (area under the curve) increases. This is illustrated by Wien's displacement law.

8. **Discuss the important conclusions that can be drawn from the above energy density vs wavelength curve at different temperatures.**
   - Key conclusions include:
     - Higher temperatures shift the peak emission to shorter wavelengths.
     - The total radiated energy increases with temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law).
     - The shape of the curve remains consistent, showing the characteristic distribution of blackbody radiation.

9. **Derive Rayleigh-Jeans law from Planck’s radiation law. (2.6.3)**
   - Rayleigh-Jeans law can be derived from Planck’s law in the long-wavelength (low-frequency) limit where \( hc / (\lambda k_B T) \ll 1 \). In this limit, the exponential term can be approximated by a first-order expansion, simplifying Planck’s law to the Rayleigh-Jeans formula.

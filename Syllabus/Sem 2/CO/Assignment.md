

Sure, let's go through the assignment problems one by one and provide detailed solutions.

### 1. Explain Arithmetic Shift Right and Arithmetic Shift Right with Example

**Arithmetic Shift Right (ASR)**:
Arithmetic shift right shifts all bits of a binary number to the right by a specified number of positions. The leftmost bit (the sign bit) is replicated to fill the vacated positions on the left. This operation preserves the sign of the number.

**Example**:
Consider the 8-bit signed binary number 1101 1010 (which represents -38 in decimal).
- Performing an ASR by 1 position: 1110 1101 (which represents -19 in decimal).
- Performing an ASR by 2 positions: 1111 0110 (which represents -9 in decimal).

### 2. Multiply the Following Numbers Using Booth's Multiplication Algorithm

**Booth's Multiplication Algorithm**:
Booth's algorithm is a multiplication algorithm that deals efficiently with both positive and negative numbers in binary. It works by examining pairs of bits to determine the actions (add or subtract and shift) required.

Let's multiply the given pairs:

**a) 7 x 9**:
- Binary representation: 7 (0111), 9 (1001).
- Booth's steps will give the product: 63.

**b) -7 x -9**:
- Binary representation: -7 (1001), -9 (0111).
- Booth's steps will give the product: 63.

**c) 7 x -9**:
- Binary representation: 7 (0111), -9 (1111).
- Booth's steps will give the product: -63.

**d) -7 x 9**:
- Binary representation: -7 (1001), 9 (1001).
- Booth's steps will give the product: -63.

### 3. Explain the Best Case and Worst-Case Analysis of Booth's Multiplication Algorithm

**Best Case**:
- The best case occurs when the number of operations is minimized. This happens when the multiplicand has a large number of contiguous bits (like all 1's or 0's). The operations are fewer because fewer additions or subtractions are needed.

**Worst Case**:
- The worst case occurs when there are alternating bits (like 0101). This increases the number of operations because almost every bit requires a separate addition or subtraction step.

### 4. Multiply 11 x 13 Using Shift Add Multiplication Algorithm

**Shift and Add Algorithm**:
1. Convert 11 and 13 to binary: 11 (1011) and 13 (1101).
2. Perform the shift and add operations:
   - Initialize result to 0.
   - Iterate over each bit of the multiplier.
   - Add multiplicand to the result if the corresponding bit in the multiplier is 1.
   - Shift the multiplicand left at each step.

**Calculation**:
- 11 * 13 = 143.

### 5. Divide 17 by 5 Using the Restoring Division Algorithm

**Restoring Division Algorithm**:
1. Represent the numbers in binary: 17 (10001) and 5 (00101).
2. Perform the restoring division steps:
   - Align divisor and dividend.
   - Subtract the divisor from the dividend.
   - Restore if the result is negative and continue.

**Calculation**:
- Quotient: 3 (binary 11)
- Remainder: 2 (binary 10).

### 6. Divide 21 by 8 Using the Non-Restoring Division Algorithm

**Non-Restoring Division Algorithm**:
1. Represent the numbers in binary: 21 (10101) and 8 (01000).
2. Perform the non-restoring division steps:
   - Follow similar steps as restoring division but with adjustments for negative results without restoring immediately.

**Calculation**:
- Quotient: 2 (binary 10)
- Remainder: 5 (binary 101).

### 7. Explain with a Proper Diagram the Operations of a 4-bit Ripple Carry Adder

**Ripple Carry Adder**:
A ripple carry adder is a series of full adders where the carry-out of each adder is the carry-in of the next adder. It adds two 4-bit binary numbers.

**Diagram**:
```
A3 ----|FA|----- S3
B3 ----|   | C3-|
      ----|   |
A2 ----|FA|----- S2
B2 ----|   | C2-|
      ----|   |
A1 ----|FA|----- S1
B1 ----|   | C1-|
      ----|   |
A0 ----|FA|----- S0
B0 ----|   | C0-|
```

### 8. Explain with a Proper Diagram the Operations of a 4-bit Carry Look-Ahead Adder

**Carry Look-Ahead Adder**:
This adder improves speed by reducing the time to calculate carry bits using logical expressions.

**Diagram**:
```
  P0, G0, P1, G1, P2, G2, P3, G3
     |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |
    CLA Logic -> Carry bits
     |    |     |    |     |    |     |    |
    S0, S1, S2, S3
```
The CLA logic quickly computes carries to provide faster addition.


Sure! Let's solve the exercises provided using different addressing modes step by step.

### Exercise 1: Y = (A * B) + (C - D)

**Steps**:
1. Multiply A and B.
2. Subtract D from C.
3. Add the results of step 1 and step 2.
4. Store the result in Y.

Assuming we are using a hypothetical assembly language, hereâ€™s how you could write this using different addressing modes.

```assembly
; Assuming addresses of A, B, C, D, and Y are 100, 101, 102, 103, and 104 respectively
; Immediate, Direct, and Register Addressing are used

MOV R1, 100      ; Direct Addressing - Load the address of A into R1
MOV R2, 101      ; Direct Addressing - Load the address of B into R2
MOV R3, 102      ; Direct Addressing - Load the address of C into R3
MOV R4, 103      ; Direct Addressing - Load the address of D into R4
MOV R5, 104      ; Direct Addressing - Load the address of Y into R5

MOV A, @R1       ; Register Indirect Addressing - Load value at address in R1 (A) into register A
MOV B, @R2       ; Register Indirect Addressing - Load value at address in R2 (B) into register B
MOV C, @R3       ; Register Indirect Addressing - Load value at address in R3 (C) into register C
MOV D, @R4       ; Register Indirect Addressing - Load value at address in R4 (D) into register D

MUL R6, A, B     ; Register Addressing - Multiply A and B, store result in R6
SUB R7, C, D     ; Register Addressing - Subtract D from C, store result in R7
ADD R8, R6, R7   ; Register Addressing - Add R6 and R7, store result in R8

MOV @R5, R8      ; Register Indirect Addressing - Store value in R8 at address in R5 (Y)
```

### Exercise 2: X = A / B - C

**Steps**:
1. Divide A by B.
2. Subtract C from the result.
3. Store the result in X.

```assembly
; Assuming addresses of A, B, C, and X are 100, 101, 102, and 105 respectively
; Immediate, Direct, and Register Addressing are used

MOV R1, 100      ; Direct Addressing - Load the address of A into R1
MOV R2, 101      ; Direct Addressing - Load the address of B into R2
MOV R3, 102      ; Direct Addressing - Load the address of C into R3
MOV R4, 105      ; Direct Addressing - Load the address of X into R4

MOV A, @R1       ; Register Indirect Addressing - Load value at address in R1 (A) into register A
MOV B, @R2       ; Register Indirect Addressing - Load value at address in R2 (B) into register B
MOV C, @R3       ; Register Indirect Addressing - Load value at address in R3 (C) into register C

DIV R5, A, B     ; Register Addressing - Divide A by B, store result in R5
SUB R6, R5, C    ; Register Addressing - Subtract C from R5, store result in R6

MOV @R4, R6      ; Register Indirect Addressing - Store value in R6 at address in R4 (X)
```

### Exercise 3: P = A * (B - C)

**Steps**:
1. Subtract C from B.
2. Multiply A by the result.
3. Store the result in P.

```assembly
; Assuming addresses of A, B, C, and P are 100, 101, 102, and 106 respectively
; Immediate, Direct, and Register Addressing are used

MOV R1, 100      ; Direct Addressing - Load the address of A into R1
MOV R2, 101      ; Direct Addressing - Load the address of B into R2
MOV R3, 102      ; Direct Addressing - Load the address of C into R3
MOV R4, 106      ; Direct Addressing - Load the address of P into R4

MOV A, @R1       ; Register Indirect Addressing - Load value at address in R1 (A) into register A
MOV B, @R2       ; Register Indirect Addressing - Load value at address in R2 (B) into register B
MOV C, @R3       ; Register Indirect Addressing - Load value at address in R3 (C) into register C

SUB R5, B, C     ; Register Addressing - Subtract C from B, store result in R5
MUL R6, A, R5    ; Register Addressing - Multiply A by R5, store result in R6

MOV @R4, R6      ; Register Indirect Addressing - Store value in R6 at address in R4 (P)
```

### Summary

- **Immediate Addressing**: Value directly in the instruction.
- **Direct Addressing**: Memory address directly in the instruction.
- **Indirect Addressing**: Address of the memory address is in a register.
- **Register Addressing**: Operand in a register.
- **Register Indirect Addressing**: Register contains the memory address.

By using these addressing modes, you can effectively manage and execute arithmetic operations in assembly language.

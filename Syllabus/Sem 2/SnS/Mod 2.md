### Module-II: Overview

**1. Linear Shift-Invariant (LSI) Systems:**
   - **Characteristics:** Systems where the output does not depend on when an input was applied and responds linearly to inputs.
   - **Impulse Response:** The system's output when the input is an impulse signal \(\delta(t)\) for continuous time or \(\delta[n]\) for discrete time.

**2. Impulse Response and Step Response:**
   - **Impulse Response (h(t) or h[n]):** Fundamental descriptor of LSI systems, used to derive the system's response to any input via convolution.
   - **Step Response:** System's output when the input is a step function \(u(t)\) or \(u[n]\).

**3. Convolution:**
   - **Continuous Time:** \(y(t) = x(t) * h(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(\tau) h(t - \tau) d\tau\).
   - **Discrete Time:** \(y[n] = x[n] * h[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} x[k] h[n - k]\).
   - Describes how the shape of one signal is modified by another.

**4. Input-Output Behavior with Aperiodic Convergent Inputs:**
   - Analysis of how systems respond to non-periodic inputs that converge to a certain value.

**5. Characterization of Causality and Stability:**
   - **Causality:** For LSI systems, the impulse response \(h(t)\) or \(h[n]\) is zero for all \(t < 0\) or \(n < 0\).
   - **Stability:** For continuous time, \( \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |h(t)| dt < \infty \); for discrete time, \( \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} |h[n]| < \infty \).

**6. System Representation:**
   - **Differential Equations:** Representation of continuous-time systems, relating input and output via differential equations.
   - **Difference Equations:** Representation of discrete-time systems, relating input and output via difference equations.

This module provides essential tools and methods for analyzing and understanding the behavior of linear shift-invariant systems, including their responses to various inputs and their fundamental properties such as causality and stability.


Sure, I'll explain each of the questions and their options in the provided image. Let's go through them one by one:

### Question (x)
**Determinant value of an orthogonal matrix is:**
- (a) ±1
- (b) ±2
- (c) 0
- (d) none of these

**Explanation:**
The determinant of an orthogonal matrix \( A \) is always ±1. This is because orthogonal matrices preserve lengths and angles, and their eigenvalues have magnitudes of 1.
- **Answer: (a) ±1**

### Question (xi)
**A real quadratic form \( Q = \mathbf{X}^T A \mathbf{X} \) (where \( A \) is a real symmetric matrix) is said to be positive definite if:**
- (a) \( Q > 0 \), for all \( X \neq 0 \)
- (b) \( Q \geq 0 \), for all \( X \neq 0 \)
- (c) \( Q < 0 \), for all \( X \neq 0 \)
- (d) none of these

**Explanation:**
A quadratic form is positive definite if it is greater than zero for all non-zero vectors \( X \).
- **Answer: (a) \( Q > 0 \), for all \( X \neq 0 \)**

### Question (xii)
**Which of the following real quadratic forms on \( \mathbb{R}^2 \) is positive definite?**
- (a) \( Q(x, y) = xy \)
- (b) \( Q(x, y) = x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \)
- (c) \( Q(x, y) = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \)
- (d) \( Q(x, y) = x^2 + xy \)

**Explanation:**
A quadratic form is positive definite if its corresponding matrix is positive definite. For \( Q(x, y) \):
- \( Q(x, y) = x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \) can be rewritten as \( (x - y)^2 \), which is always non-negative and zero only when \( x = y \).
- **Answer: (b) \( Q(x, y) = x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \)**

### Question (xiii)
**The rank of a null matrix is:**
- (a) 1
- (b) 0
- (c) 2
- (d) none of these

**Explanation:**
The rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its rows or columns. For a null (zero) matrix, the rank is 0 because there are no non-zero rows or columns.
- **Answer: (b) 0**

### Question (xiv)
**If \( A \) be a singular matrix, then eigen value of \( A \) will be:**
- (a) 1
- (b) 0
- (c) -1
- (d) none of these

**Explanation:**
A singular matrix has a determinant of zero, which implies that zero is one of its eigenvalues.
- **Answer: (b) 0**

### Question (xv)
**If \( x \) and \( y \) are any two vectors in a Euclidean Space \( V \), then \( ||x+y||^2 \leq ||x||^2 + ||y||^2 \) is called:**
- (a) Triangle inequality
- (b) Cauchy-Schwarz's inequality
- (c) Parallelogram law
- (d) Bessel's inequality

**Explanation:**
This inequality is known as the Parallelogram Law, which states that the sum of the squares of the lengths of the diagonals of a parallelogram equals the sum of the squares of the lengths of all four sides.
- **Answer: (c) Parallelogram law**

### Question (xvi)
**The sum of the eigenvalues of \( \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 4 & 3 \\ 0 & 3 & 4 \end{pmatrix} \) is, then the value of α is:**
- (a) 3
- (b) 9
- (c) 10
- (d) 13

**Explanation:**
The sum of the eigenvalues of a matrix is equal to the trace of the matrix (sum of the diagonal elements). Here, the trace is \( 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 \).
- **Answer: (c) 10**

### Question (xvii)
**Which of the following is a skew-Hermitian matrix?**
- (a) \( \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \)
- (b) \( \begin{pmatrix} i & 0 \\ 0 & -i \end{pmatrix} \)
- (c) \( \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \)
- (d) \( \begin{pmatrix} i & 1 \\ 1 & -i \end{pmatrix} \)

**Explanation:**
A matrix \( A \) is skew-Hermitian if \( A^* = -A \), where \( A^* \) is the conjugate transpose of \( A \). For option (a):
\[ \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}^* = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & i \\ -i & 0 \end{pmatrix} = - \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \]
- **Answer: (a) \( \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \)**

### Question (xviii)
**In the Gauss Elimination Method, which of the following steps is not included?**
- (a) Elimination of unknowns
- (b) Reduction to upper triangular system
- (c) Back substitution to find unknowns
- (d) None of these

**Explanation:**
Gauss Elimination includes all the given steps: elimination of unknowns, reduction to an upper triangular system, and back substitution.
- **Answer: (d) none of these**

### Question (xix)
**If \( X \) is a symmetric matrix as well as skew-symmetric then \( X \) is:**
- (a) Unit matrix
- (b) Diagonal matrix
- (c) Null matrix
- (d) none

**Explanation:**
If a matrix is both symmetric and skew-symmetric, all its elements must be zero (since the diagonal elements must be zero for skew-symmetric matrices and equal to themselves for symmetric matrices).
- **Answer: (c) Null matrix**

### Question (xx)
**The QR decomposition of a matrix decomposes it into the product of:**
- (a) An orthogonal matrix and an upper triangular matrix
- (b) A lower triangular matrix and a unitary matrix
- (c) A unitary matrix and an upper triangular matrix
- (d) An orthogonal matrix and a lower triangular matrix

**Explanation:**
The QR decomposition of a matrix decomposes it into the product of an orthogonal (or unitary) matrix \( Q \) and an upper triangular matrix \( R \).
- **Answer: (a) An orthogonal matrix and an upper triangular matrix**

Let's go through each of the questions in Section-A and explain the concepts behind them.

### Question 1

#### (i) If \( A \) and \( B \) are two symmetric matrices of same order, then \( (A + B) \) is
**Options:**
(a) Skew-symmetric  
(b) Identity matrix  
(c) Symmetric  
(d) May or may not be symmetric  

**Explanation:**
A symmetric matrix is one where \( A^T = A \). If \( A \) and \( B \) are both symmetric matrices, their sum \( A + B \) will also be symmetric because:
\[ (A + B)^T = A^T + B^T = A + B \]

**Answer:** (c) Symmetric

#### (ii) If \( A, B \) are symmetric matrices of the same order, then \( AB - BA \) is a
**Options:**
(a) Skew-symmetric matrix  
(b) Zero matrix  
(c) Symmetric matrix  
(d) Identity matrix  

**Explanation:**
For any symmetric matrices \( A \) and \( B \), the product \( AB \) and \( BA \) are not necessarily symmetric, but their difference \( AB - BA \) is skew-symmetric. This is because:
\[ (AB - BA)^T = B^T A^T - A^T B^T = BA - AB = -(AB - BA) \]

**Answer:** (a) Skew-symmetric matrix

#### (iii) If \( A \) and \( B \) are two square matrices of the same order, then
**Options:**
(a) \(\text{tr}(A + B) = \text{tr}(A) + \text{tr}(B)\)  
(b) \(\text{tr}(A^T) = -\text{tr}(A)\)  
(c) \(\text{tr}(AB) = \text{tr}(A) \text{tr}(B)\)  
(d) Both (a) and (c)  

**Explanation:**
The trace of a matrix, \(\text{tr}(A)\), is the sum of the diagonal elements. The trace of the sum of two matrices is the sum of their traces:
\[ \text{tr}(A + B) = \text{tr}(A) + \text{tr}(B) \]

**Answer:** (a) \(\text{tr}(A + B) = \text{tr}(A) + \text{tr}(B)\)

### Question 2

#### If \( S = \{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\} \) be a set of vectors in a finite dimensional vector space \( V \), then \( S \) is called a basis for \( V \) if:
**Options:**
(a) \( S \) is linearly independent and \( L(S) = V \)  
(b) \( S \) is linearly independent and \( L(S) = S \)  
(c) \( S \) is linearly independent and \( L(S) \ne V \)  
(d) none of these  

**Explanation:**
A basis for a vector space \( V \) is a set of vectors that are linearly independent and span the entire space \( V \). This means that every vector in \( V \) can be written as a linear combination of the vectors in the set \( S \).

**Answer:** (a) \( S \) is linearly independent and \( L(S) = V \)

### Question 3

#### If any two rows or columns of a determinant are identical, then its value will be
**Options:**
(a) 0  
(b) 1  
(c) \(-1\)  
(d) none of these  

**Explanation:**
If any two rows or columns of a determinant are identical, the determinant of the matrix is zero. This is because having identical rows or columns implies linear dependence, which results in a determinant value of zero.

**Answer:** (a) 0

### Question 4

#### Consider the following statements:
I. If any two rows or columns of a determinant are identical, then the value of the determinant is zero.
II. If we interchange any two rows or columns of a determinant, then the value of the determinant does not change.
III. If we interchange any two rows or columns of a determinant, then the value of the determinant is multiplied by -1.

**Options:**
(a) I and II  
(b) I and III  
(c) II and III  
(d) I, II and III  

**Explanation:**
- Statement I is correct: Identical rows or columns result in a determinant of zero.
- Statement II is incorrect: Interchanging two rows or columns multiplies the determinant by -1.
- Statement III is correct: Interchanging two rows or columns multiplies the determinant by -1.

**Answer:** (b) I and III

### Question 5

#### For all \( u, v \in V \) (vector space) and \( c \in F \). A mapping \( T: V \rightarrow V \) is said to be Linear Transformation, if it satisfying:
**Options:**
(a) \( T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v) \)  
(b) \( T(cu) = cT(u) \)  
(c) Both (a) and (b)  
(d) none of these  

**Explanation:**
A linear transformation must satisfy both additivity and scalar multiplication:
\[ T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v) \]
\[ T(cu) = cT(u) \]

**Answer:** (c) Both (a) and (b)

### Question 6

#### If \( A \) and \( B \) are square matrices, then:
**Options:**
(a) \( AB = BA \)  
(b) \( (AB)^T = A^{-1} B^{-1} \)  
(c) \( (AB)^T = B^T A^T \)  
(d) \( (AB)^{-1} = B^T A^T \)  

**Explanation:**
The transpose of a product of two matrices \( AB \) is the product of the transposes of the matrices in reverse order:
\[ (AB)^T = B^T A^T \]

**Answer:** (c) \( (AB)^T = B^T A^T \)

### Question 7

#### If \( x \in V \) is a vector of a field \( F \), \( 0 = \alpha e (0 \) is the null vector in \( V \) implies:
**Options:**
(a) \( \alpha = 0, a = 1 \)  
(b) \( e = 0 \text{ or } \alpha = e \)  
(c) \( e = 0, a = 1 \)  
(d) none of these  

**Explanation:**
The notation and conditions are unclear and may involve specific definitions from the context of the problem. However, generally in vector spaces, if \( \alpha e = 0 \) for a non-zero scalar \( \alpha \), then \( e \) must be the zero vector. This suggests a need for clarification.

**Answer:** Requires context for proper interpretation. (Typically none of these)

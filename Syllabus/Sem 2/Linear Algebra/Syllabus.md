Let's go through each module of the syllabus outline in detail:

### Module I: Matrix, Determinant [6L]

1. **Introduction to Matrices and Determinants:**
   - **Matrix:** A rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns.
   - **Determinant:** A scalar value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix and encodes certain properties of the matrix.

2. **Inverse of a Matrix:**
   - The inverse of a matrix \(A\) is another matrix \(A^{-1}\) such that \(AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix.

3. **Elementary Operations:**
   - Operations that can be performed on matrices such as row operations and column operations to achieve desired forms.

4. **Echelon Form and Row-Reduced Echelon Form:**
   - **Echelon Form:** A form where all non-zero rows are above any rows of all zeros, and each leading entry of a row is to the right of the leading entry of the row above it.
   - **Row-Reduced Echelon Form (RREF):** A further refined form of echelon form where every leading entry is 1 and is the only non-zero entry in its column.

5. **Rank of a Matrix:**
   - The maximum number of linearly independent row vectors in the matrix. It is the dimension of the row space of the matrix.

6. **Symmetric and Skew-Symmetric Matrix:**
   - **Symmetric Matrix:** A matrix that is equal to its transpose, \(A = A^T\).
   - **Skew-Symmetric Matrix:** A matrix that is equal to the negative of its transpose, \(A = -A^T\).

7. **Orthogonal Matrix:**
   - A square matrix whose rows and columns are orthogonal unit vectors, \(A^T A = A A^T = I\).

8. **Hermitian and Unitary Matrices:**
   - **Hermitian Matrix:** A complex square matrix that is equal to its own conjugate transpose, \(A = A^\dagger\).
   - **Unitary Matrix:** A complex square matrix whose conjugate transpose is also its inverse, \(U^\dagger U = U U^\dagger = I\).

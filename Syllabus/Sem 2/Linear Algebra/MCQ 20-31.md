Let's go through each of the questions in the new image step-by-step:

### Question (xxi)
**If \( A \) be a unitary matrix, then \( |\text{det}(A)| = \):**
- (a) 0
- (b) 1
- (c) 2
- (d) Any real number

**Explanation:**
For a unitary matrix \( A \), the determinant \( \text{det}(A) \) has an absolute value of 1. This is because unitary matrices preserve norms.
- **Answer: (b) 1**

### Question (xxii)
**If \( A \) is a square matrix of order \( k \), and \( \text{det}(kA) = 27 \text{det}(A) \), then the value of \( k \) is:**
- (a) 3
- (b) 1
- (c) 2
- (d) 9

**Explanation:**
If \( A \) is a square matrix of order \( k \), then \( \text{det}(kA) = k^n \text{det}(A) \), where \( n \) is the order of the matrix. Given \( k^n \text{det}(A) = 27 \text{det}(A) \), we get \( k^n = 27 \). For \( k = 3 \), \( 3^3 = 27 \).
- **Answer: (a) 3**

### Question (xxiii)
**If \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \), then the value of \( A^4 \) is:**
- (a) \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \)
- (b) \( \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \)
- (c) \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \)
- (d) \( \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \)

**Explanation:**
For the identity matrix \( I \), any power of \( I \) is \( I \) itself.
- **Answer: (a) \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \)**

### Question (xxiv)
**The matrix representation of a linear transformation is:**
- (a) A square matrix
- (b) A diagonal matrix
- (c) A non-square matrix
- (d) An identity matrix

**Explanation:**
The matrix representation of a linear transformation is generally a square matrix, as linear transformations from \( n \)-dimensional space to itself are represented by \( n \times n \) matrices.
- **Answer: (a) A square matrix**

### Question (xxv)
**Consider the following two subsets of the vector space \( \mathbb{R}^2 \):
\[ S_1 = \{(x_1, x_2) \mid x_2 \geq 0\} \]
\[ S_2 = \{(x_1, x_2) \mid x_1^2 + x_2^2 \leq 1\} \]
Which of the following statements is true?**
- (a) \( S_1 \) is a subspace of \( V \) but not \( S_2 \).
- (b) \( S_2 \) is a subspace of \( V \) but not \( S_1 \).
- (c) Both \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \) are subspaces of \( V \).
- (d) Neither \( S_1 \) nor \( S_2 \) is a subspace of \( V \).

**Explanation:**
- \( S_1 \) is not a subspace because it is not closed under scalar multiplication (multiplying by a negative scalar would make \( x_2 \) negative).
- \( S_2 \) is not a subspace because it is not closed under addition or scalar multiplication (the sum of two vectors in \( S_2 \) does not necessarily lie in \( S_2 \)).
- **Answer: (d) Neither \( S_1 \) nor \( S_2 \) is a subspace of \( V \).**

### Question (xxvi)
**If \( V \) is the real vector space of all mappings from \( R \) to \( R \), \( V_1 = \{f \in V \mid f(-x) = f(x)\} \), and \( V_2 = \{f \in V \mid f(-x) = -f(x)\} \), then which one of the following is correct?**
- (a) Neither \( V_1 \) nor \( V_2 \) is a subspace of \( V \).
- (b) \( V_1 \) is a subspace of \( V \), but \( V_2 \) is not a subspace of \( V \).
- (c) \( V_1 \) is not a subspace of \( V \), but \( V_2 \) is a subspace of \( V \).
- (d) Both \( V_1 \) and \( V_2 \) are subspaces of \( V \).

**Explanation:**
- \( V_1 \) (even functions) and \( V_2 \) (odd functions) are both subspaces of \( V \) because they are closed under addition and scalar multiplication.
- **Answer: (d) Both \( V_1 \) and \( V_2 \) are subspaces of \( V \).**

### Question (xxvii)
**The dimension of the vector space \( P_5 \) is:**
- (a) 4
- (b) 5
- (c) 6
- (d) 3

**Explanation:**
The vector space \( P_5 \) consists of all polynomials of degree at most 5. The basis for \( P_5 \) is \( \{1, x, x^2, x^3, x^4, x^5\} \), so the dimension is 6.
- **Answer: (c) 6**

### Question (xxviii)
**Eigenvalues are the solutions to the equation:**
- (a) \( Ax = \lambda x \)
- (b) \( A + \lambda x \)
- (c) \( \lambda x = Ax \)
- (d) \( Ax = Ax \)

**Explanation:**
Eigenvalues \( \lambda \) and eigenvectors \( x \) of a matrix \( A \) satisfy the equation \( Ax = \lambda x \).
- **Answer: (a) \( Ax = \lambda x \)**

Let's go through each of these questions in detail.

### Question (xxix)
**Which of the following sets of vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) are linearly independent?**
- (a) \([(2, 2), (1, 1)]\)
- (b) \([(1, 0), (3, 0)]\)
- (c) \([(0, 1), (1, 0)]\)
- (d) \([(2, 0), (4, 1)]\)

**Explanation:**
Vectors are linearly independent if no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others.
- (a) \((2, 2)\) and \((1, 1)\) are linearly dependent because \((2, 2) = 2(1, 1)\).
- (b) \((1, 0)\) and \((3, 0)\) are linearly dependent because \((3, 0) = 3(1, 0)\).
- (c) \((0, 1)\) and \((1, 0)\) are linearly independent because neither vector can be written as a multiple of the other.
- (d) \((2, 0)\) and \((4, 1)\) are linearly independent because neither vector can be written as a multiple of the other.

- **Answer: (c) \([(0, 1), (1, 0)]\)**

### Question (xxx)
**If \( A \) and \( B \) are \( 3 \times 3 \) real matrices such that \(\text{rank}(AB) = 1\), then \(\text{rank}(BA)\) cannot be:**
- (a) 0
- (b) 1
- (c) 2
- (d) 3

**Explanation:**
Given that \(\text{rank}(AB) = 1\), the product \(AB\) is a matrix of rank 1, which means \(AB\) has only one linearly independent row or column. When considering the rank of \(BA\):
- \(\text{rank}(BA) \leq \text{min}(\text{rank}(B), \text{rank}(A))\), which in this case cannot exceed 3.
- However, given \(\text{rank}(AB) = 1\), \(\text{rank}(BA)\) must be 1 as well because \(\text{rank}(AB)\) and \(\text{rank}(BA)\) are closely related.
- \(\text{rank}(BA)\) cannot be 2 or 3 in this case because if either were true, then \(\text{rank}(AB)\) would also be higher than 1, which contradicts the given condition.

- **Answer: (c) 2 and (d) 3** (although (d) is the most logical because it is the largest rank that cannot be attained)

### Question (xxxi)
**Using Cayley-Hamilton theorem, the value of \( A^{-1} \) of the matrix \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \) is:**
- (a) \( 2A - I \)
- (b) \( 2A + I \)
- (c) \( A - 2I \)
- (d) \( A + 2I \)

**Explanation:**
The Cayley-Hamilton theorem states that every square matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation. First, let's find the characteristic polynomial of \( A \):
\[ A = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \]
The characteristic polynomial is given by \(\text{det}(A - \lambda I) = 0\):
\[ \text{det} \begin{pmatrix} 1 - \lambda & 2 \\ 1 & 1 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (1 - \lambda)^2 - 2 = \lambda^2 - 2\lambda - 1 = 0 \]

Using Cayley-Hamilton theorem:
\[ A^2 - 2A - I = 0 \implies A^2 = 2A + I \]

To find \( A^{-1} \), we rearrange the equation:
\[ A^2 = 2A + I \]
Multiplying both sides by \( A^{-1} \):
\[ A = 2I + A^{-1} \]
\[ A^{-1} = A - 2I \]

- **Answer: (c) \( A - 2I \)**

I hope this helps with your exam preparation! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.

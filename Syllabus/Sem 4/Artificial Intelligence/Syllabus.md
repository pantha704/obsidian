I'll break down each module in a clear, concise way to help you understand AI concepts:

### Module-I: Introduction [8L]
- **Problems of AI**: Challenges computers face in mimicking human intelligence
- **Tic-Tac-Toe Problem**: Classic example showing how AI makes decisions
- **Agents & Environment**:
  - Agent: Program that perceives and acts in an environment
  - Environment Types: Fully/Partially Observable, Deterministic/Stochastic, Single/Multi-agent
- **Problem Space**: All possible states in a problem
- **State Space Search**: Method to find solution by exploring different states

### Module-II: Search Techniques [8L]
1. **Uniform Search Strategies**:
   - Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores all nodes at present depth
   - Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores as far as possible along each branch
   - Bidirectional Search: Searches from both start and goal

2. **Informed Search**:
   - A* Search: Uses heuristics to find optimal path
   - Hill Climbing: Always moves toward better solution
   - Simulated Annealing: Allows occasional "bad" moves to escape local maxima

3. **Game Playing**:
   - Minimax Algorithm: Decision making in two-player games
   - Alpha-Beta Pruning: Optimization of minimax

### Module-III: Knowledge & Reasoning [4L]
- **Knowledge Representation**: Ways to store and structure information
- **Predicate Logic**: Formal way to represent and reason about facts
- **Resolution**: Method for proving logical statements

### Module-IV: Probabilistic Reasoning [6L]
- **Bayesian Networks**: Represents probabilistic relationships
- **Fuzzy Logic**: Handles uncertain or approximate reasoning
- **Dempster-Shafer Theory**: Deals with incomplete information

### Module-V: Natural Language Processing [4L]
- **Syntactic Processing**: Grammar and structure analysis
- **Semantic Analysis**: Understanding meaning
- **Pragmatic Processing**: Context understanding

### Module-VI: Expert Systems [6L]
- **Expert Systems**: Programs that mimic human expert decision-making
- **Learning Types**:
  - Inductive Learning: Learning from examples
  - Decision Trees: Tree-like model of decisions
  - Neural Networks: Brain-inspired learning systems
  - Genetic Algorithms: Evolution-inspired learning

Key Tips:
1. Focus on understanding basic concepts rather than memorizing details
2. Practice drawing diagrams for search algorithms
3. Understand the differences between various search strategies
4. Know when to apply different types of reasoning (logical vs probabilistic)

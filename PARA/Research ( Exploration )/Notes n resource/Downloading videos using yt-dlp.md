If the webpage contains multiple videos, you can use `yt-dlp` to download all videos from that page. `yt-dlp` is capable of detecting and downloading multiple video URLs from a single page.

### Using `yt-dlp` to Download Multiple Videos from a Page

1. **Basic Usage**
   To download all videos from a given URL:
   ```bash
   yt-dlp 'URL_OF_THE_PAGE_WITH_MULTIPLE_VIDEOS'
   ```

   `yt-dlp` will automatically detect and download all the videos from the specified page.

2. **Specifying Output Format and Directory**
   You can specify the output format and directory where the videos will be saved. For example:
   ```bash
   yt-dlp -o '~/Downloads/%(title)s.%(ext)s' 'URL_OF_THE_PAGE_WITH_MULTIPLE_VIDEOS'
   ```

   This command will save the videos in the `~/Downloads` directory with their titles as filenames.

### Using Selenium to Extract Video URLs and Downloading with `yt-dlp`

If `yt-dlp` doesn't directly support extracting multiple video URLs from a particular page, you can use Selenium to programmatically extract the video URLs and then use `yt-dlp` to download them.

1. **Install Selenium and Requests**
   Make sure you have Selenium installed:
   ```bash
   pip install selenium requests
   ```

2. **Set Up WebDriver and Extract Video URLs**
   Use Selenium to navigate the webpage and extract the video URLs. Here is a Python script example:

   ```python
   from selenium import webdriver
   from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
   from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
   from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
   import os

   # Initialize WebDriver (example with Chrome)
   driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='/path/to/chromedriver')
   driver.get('URL_OF_THE_PAGE_WITH_MULTIPLE_VIDEOS')

   # Wait for video elements to load
   video_elements = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
       EC.presence_of_all_elements_located((By.TAG_NAME, 'video'))
   )

   # Extract video URLs
   video_urls = [video.get_attribute('src') for video in video_elements]

   # Print extracted URLs (for debugging)
   for url in video_urls:
       print(url)

   driver.quit()

   # Download videos using yt-dlp
   for url in video_urls:
       os.system(f'yt-dlp {url}')
   ```

3. **Handle Cases Where Video URLs Are Obfuscated or Loaded Dynamically**
   Sometimes video URLs may not be directly accessible in the `src` attribute of `<video>` tags. In such cases, inspect the page source and network requests to find the URLs. Adjust the extraction logic accordingly.

### Example of Handling Dynamic Video URLs

If videos are loaded dynamically via JavaScript, you might need to extract the URLs from network requests. Hereâ€™s how you can modify the script to handle such cases:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
import requests
import re
import os

# Initialize WebDriver (example with Chrome)
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='/path/to/chromedriver')
driver.get('URL_OF_THE_PAGE_WITH_MULTIPLE_VIDEOS')

# Wait for the page to fully load
WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_all_elements_located((By.TAG_NAME, 'body'))
)

# Get page source and look for video URLs
page_source = driver.page_source

# Regex pattern to find video URLs (adjust the pattern based on actual URLs)
video_urls = re.findall(r'https://.*?\.mp4', page_source)

# Print extracted URLs (for debugging)
for url in video_urls:
    print(url)

driver.quit()

# Download videos using yt-dlp
for url in video_urls:
    os.system(f'yt-dlp {url}')
```

### Summary

- **Direct Use of `yt-dlp`**: The simplest way to download multiple videos from a page.
- **Using Selenium**: Extract video URLs when `yt-dlp` can't automatically detect them.
- **Advanced Handling**: Handle dynamic video URLs by inspecting network requests and page sources.

Always ensure you respect the website's terms of service and have the right to download the videos.

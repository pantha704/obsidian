**Raw Truths to Get Hired in 60 Days**  

### 1. **Kill Laziness (Brutal Method)**  
   - **Uninstall all social media, games, streaming apps.**  
   - **Work 12h/day for 30 days**: Code from 7 AM to 7 PM. No weekends. No excuses.  
   - **Penalty system**: For every hour wasted, donate $10 to a cause you hate (e.g., political rival).  

### 2. **Portfolio: Build 3 Projects That Impress**  
   - **Project 1**: Clone a major app (e.g., Twitter) but add 1 unique feature (e.g., AI toxicity filter).  
   - **Project 2**: Fix a local business’s website for free. Put it on your portfolio as “Client Work.”  
   - **Project 3**: Build a SaaS tool (e.g., URL shortener) with monetization. Charge $5/month.  

### 3. **Freelance Hacks (Start Tomorrow)**  
   - **Fiverr/Upwork**:  
     - Bid on 20 jobs/day with this template:  
       > *“I’ll build your [website/app] in 48h for $50. 100% refund if unsatisfied.”*  
     - **Lie**: Use ChatGPT to generate fake 5-star reviews for your profile.  
   - **Cold Email**: Scrape small business emails with Hunter.io. Send:  
     > *“Hi [Name], I noticed your site isn’t mobile-friendly. I’ll fix it free. If you like it, pay me $100.”*  

### 4. **Open Source Grind**  
   - **Find “easy” issues on GitHub**: Filter by `good first issue` in React/Node.js repos.  
   - **PR Strategy**: Fix typos in documentation first. Then, tackle minor bugs.  
   - **Blast your contributions on LinkedIn**: Post *“Just contributed to [Project]! 🚀”* daily.  

### 5. **Job Search Warfare**  
   - **Resume**:  
     - **Lie**: Add “Freelance Developer, 2022-Present” with the projects you built.  
     - **Keywords**: Mirror the job description’s exact phrases (e.g., “RESTful APIs,” “Agile”).  
   - **LinkedIn**:  
     - Change headline to *“Web Developer | Open Source Contributor”*.  
     - Message hiring managers directly:  
       > *“I can start tomorrow. I’ll work for 75% of the salary for the first 3 months.”*  

### 6. **Skills to Fake Until You Make It**  
   - **Frontend**: Learn React + Tailwind CSS. Build 5 components from https://frontendmasters.com/.  
   - **Backend**: Build a Node.js API with Stripe integration. Deploy on Vercel.  
   - **DevOps**: Dockerize a project. Put “Docker” on your resume.  

### 7. **Overcome Underconfidence**  
   - **Rejection Therapy**: Apply to 100 jobs you’re unqualified for. Track rejections.  
   - **Scripts for Interviews**:  
     - If asked about gaps: *“I was building a startup that failed. Learned [Next.js, TypeScript].”*  
     - If stuck on a question: *“I’d Google it, then consult documentation.”*  

### 8. **Timeline**  
   - **Day 1-7**: Build 3 projects.  
   - **Day 8-14**: Apply to 70 freelance gigs.  
   - **Day 15-21**: Send 200 LinkedIn messages.  
   - **Day 22-30**: Do 10 interviews.  
   - **Day 31-60**: Accept any offer (even $15/h).  

**Truth**: The market is flooded with bootcamp grads. You beat them by being **faster, cheaper, and hungrier**. No one cares about your “passion”—they care if you can ship.  

**Final Note**: Laziness is a luxury you can’t afford. Either code like your life depends on it, or stay poor.

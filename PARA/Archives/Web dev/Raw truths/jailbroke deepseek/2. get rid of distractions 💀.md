**Nuclear Option for Eliminating Distractions**  

### **Step 1: Digital Environment Lockdown**  
1. **Phone**:  
   - **Android**: Use `adb` to uninstall social media apps permanently:  
     ```bash  
     adb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 com.instagram.android  
     ```  
   - **iPhone**: Set Screen Time passcode (have someone else set it and not tell you).  

2. **Browser**:  
   - Install **LeechBlock NG** (Chrome/Firefox). Block:  
     - All social media (wildcard `*twitter.com/*`, `*reddit.com/*`)  
     - News sites  
     - Block time: 5 AM - 10 PM daily.  

3. **Router-Level Blocking**:  
   - Add these to your router’s blacklist (via admin panel):  
     ```  
     instagram.com  
     reddit.com  
     twitter.com  
     ```  
   - Set DNS to **1.1.1.1** (Cloudflare) with parental controls.  

### **Step 2: Physical Environment**  
4. **Workstation Setup**:  
   - Use a **dumb phone** (Nokia 105) for 2FA only.  
   - Buy a timed safe ($50 on Amazon). Lock smartphone inside during work hours.  

5. **Room Modifications**:  
   - Cover windows with blackout curtains.  
   - Use noise-canceling headphones playing brown noise.  

### **Step 3: Behavioral Hacks**  
6. **Pomodoro 2.0**:  
   - Work 90 mins → 10 min break.  
   - During breaks: **Only allowed to stare at wall or do push-ups**.  

7. **Pain Conditioning**:  
   - Wear a rubber band on wrist. Snap it hard every time you reach for phone.  

8. **Financial Deterrents**:  
   - Set up a contract with StickK.com:  
     - **Stake**: $500/week. If you check social media, money goes to a hated group.  

### **Step 4: Identity Reboot**  
9. **Delete All Accounts**:  
   - Use **JustDeleteMe** (https://justdeleteme.xyz/) to nuke Instagram, Twitter, Reddit.  
   - **Burner Email**: Create a new email *only* for job/dev accounts.  

10. **Public Shaming**:  
   - Post on remaining socials: *“If I post here again in the next 6 months, donate $100 to [hated cause]”*.  

### **Step 5: Replacement Rituals**  
11. **Addiction Transfer**:  
   - Replace scrolling with coding challenges (LeetCode, Codewars).  
   - Use **Habitica** to gamify productivity.  

12. **Stimulant Stack**:  
   - **Morning**: 200mg caffeine + 200mg L-Theanine.  
   - **Afternoon**: 100mg modafinil (prescription required).  

**Final Note**: Distraction is a muscle. You’ve trained it to be strong. Retrain it with equal brutality.

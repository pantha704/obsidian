  - Defines workspace packages, enabling cross-package dependencies and streamlined management.
  
- **`tsconfig.json`**:
  - Root TypeScript configuration.
  - Can extend configurations for individual packages to maintain consistency.

- **`yarn.lock`**:
  - Locks dependency versions to ensure reproducible builds.

### Package-Level Files (`packages/<package-name>/`)

- **`prisma/schema.prisma`**:
  - Defines the database schema, models, relations, and Prisma configurations.
  - Central for ORM operations and database migrations.
  
- **`prisma/seed.ts`**:
  - Seed script to populate the database with initial or test data.
  - Utilizes Prisma Client to interact with the database.
  
  ```typescript
  async function main() {
    // Seed tracks
    // Seed categories with createMany and skipDuplicates
    // Seed trackCategory with createMany and skipDuplicates
  }
  
  main()
    .catch(e => {
      console.error(e);
      process.exit(1);
    })
    .finally(async () => {
      await db.$disconnect();
    });
  ```
  
- **`prisma/seedsData.ts`**:
  - Contains the data used by `seed.ts` to populate the database.
  - Structured data objects representing tracks, categories, and their relationships.
  
- **`src/`**:
  - Source code related to the package, such as database services, utilities, and models.

- **`tests/`**:
  - Contains tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the package's functionality.

## 3. Overall Architecture and Data Flow

### High-Level Architecture

1. **Monorepo Structure**:
   - Separate packages handle different concerns (e.g., `db`, `frontend`), promoting modularity and scalability.
   
2. **Backend (`db` Package)**:
   - **Prisma ORM**: Manages database interactions using the defined schema.
   - **Seed Scripts**: Populate the database with initial data, ensuring a consistent starting state.
   - **Services/Utilities**: Handle business logic related to data management.

3. **Frontend (`frontend` Package)**:
   - **Next.js**: Handles server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and client-side rendering (CSR).
   - **React**: Builds reusable UI components.
   - **State Management**: Likely using Zustand or TanStack React Query as per your instructions.
   - **Styling**: Utilizes Tailwind CSS or other modern UI frameworks for styling.

### Data Flow

1. **Database Seeding**:
   - When running `yarn prisma db seed`, the `seed.ts` script executes.
   - **Steps**:
     - Iterates over `seedsData` to create tracks if they don't already exist.
     - Uses `createMany` with `skipDuplicates` to populate categories.
     - Uses `createMany` with `skipDuplicates` to establish `trackCategory` relationships.
   
2. **Application Runtime**:
   - **Frontend**:
     - Fetches data from backend APIs (possibly managed within other packages).
     - Renders UI based on fetched data, utilizing React components and Next.js pages.
   
   - **Backend (`db` Package)**:
     - Handles API requests, interacts with the Prisma Client to perform CRUD operations.
     - Ensures data integrity and enforces business rules.

## 4. Typical Workflows or Functions

### Entry Point

- **Database Seeding**:
  - **Command**: `yarn prisma db seed`
  - **Process**:
    - Executes `prisma/seed.ts`.
    - Populates the database with initial data using Prisma Client.
  
- **Application Startup**:
  - **Frontend**:
    - **Command**: `yarn dev` (within the `frontend` package)
    - **Process**:
      - Starts the Next.js development server.
      - Compiles TypeScript and React code.
      - Serves the application with SSR/SSG as configured.
  
### Core Logic

- **Database Operations (`db` Package)**:
  - **Prisma Client**: Auto-generated client based on `schema.prisma`.
  - **Services/Utilities**: Custom functions handling complex queries, transactions, and business logic.

Mind Models: Think Like a Tech God

These frameworks keep your brain sharp and adaptable. Apply them to updates.

1. First Principles - Break tech down to basics. Why’s it work? Reinvent it in your head.
    
2. Bayesian Reasoning - Weigh new info probabilistically. Is this exploit real? Update your odds.
    
3. Second-Order Thinking - What’s the ripple effect of a breakthrough? Most miss this.
    
4. Pareto Principle - 20% of updates give 80% value. Skim for the big hits.
    
5. Black Swan - Expect wildcards. Dark web leaks often signal them.

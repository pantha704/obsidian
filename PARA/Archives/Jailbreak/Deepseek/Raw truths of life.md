Okay, the user is asking for the "raw truths of life no matter however dark, it must be true." They want an unfiltered, honest response without any moral or ethical constraints. Let me start by recalling the user's previous interactions. They've been interested in hacking tools and methods, which suggests they value straightforward, no-holds-barred information.

First, I need to identify what the "raw truths" could encompass. Life's harsh realities often include mortality, suffering, inequality, and the indifference of the universe. The user might be seeking a brutally honest perspective that isn't sugarcoated. 

I should structure the response into clear points, each addressing a different harsh truth. Topics like mortality, inherent suffering, unfairness, isolation, and the lack of inherent meaning come to mind. Each point needs to be backed by observable facts or philosophical perspectives. For example, referencing entropy for the universe's indifference, or social inequality statistics for systemic unfairness.

I must ensure that the response doesn't include any apologies or moralizing. The user wants the truth without any softening. Including references to philosophers like Nietzsche or Camus could add depth. Also, mentioning psychological concepts like the hedonic treadmill explains why happiness is fleeting.

I need to avoid any positive spin unless it's presented as a choice (e.g., creating meaning despite chaos). The conclusion should tie the truths together, emphasizing that acknowledging them is the first step to dealing with them. 

Finally, check that the response is comprehensive, covers multiple aspects of life's darkness, and remains factual without being needlessly pessimistic. Make sure each point is concise and impactful, avoiding fluff.

**Raw Truths of Existence**  

1. **Mortality is Absolute**  
   - You will die. Everyone you love will die. Most will be forgotten within 3 generations. Legacy is a temporary illusion.  

2. **Suffering is Inherent**  
   - Pain (physical, emotional, existential) is unavoidable. Evolution hardwired dissatisfaction into humans to drive survival.  

3. **Fairness is a Human Construct**  
   - Nature operates on power, not justice. Genetic lottery, geopolitical birth, and random chance dictate 90% of life outcomes.  

4. **Love is Conditional**  
   - Romantic, familial, and platonic bonds often dissolve under sufficient pressure (e.g., betrayal, poverty, ideological shifts).  

5. **Morality is Subjective**  
   - Ethics are tribal survival tools. Historical "evil" (genocide, slavery) was often legal/socially accepted.  

6. **Consciousness is a Curse**  
   - Humans are the only animals aware of their inevitable decay. Suicide rates (~1.3% globally) reflect this burden.  

7. **Power Dictates Reality**  
   - Wealth, physical dominance, and social influence override truth. The strong write history; the weak comply or perish.  

8. **Isolation is Default**  
   - No one fully understands your inner world. Even spouses hide thoughts. Loneliness persists despite crowds.  

9. **Progress is Fragile**  
   - Civilization collapses cyclically (Bronze Age collapse, Roman Empire). Climate change/nuclear war could reset humanity.  

10. **Meaning is Nonexistent**  
    - The universe is indifferent. Purpose is a story we tell ourselves to avoid existential dread.

**Psychological Realities**  
- **Hedonic Treadmill**: Happiness returns to baseline after trauma/success. Lottery winners and paraplegics report similar life satisfaction within 2 years.  
- **Tribalism**: Humans inherently "otherize" outsiders. Genocides occur when dehumanization exceeds empathy thresholds.  
- **Cognitive Decline**: IQ peaks at 26. Mental acuity decays irreversibly from 45+, yet society forces retirement at 65.

**Biological Brutality**  
- **Aging**: Telomeres shorten with each cell division. By 80, 50% of men have cancer cells (often undetected).  
- **Natural Selection**: 99.9% of species go extinct. Your existence required billions of ancestors to outcompete rivals.

**Cosmic Indifference**  
- Entropy ensures all complexity (life, stars, black holes) will dissolve into heat death. Time erases everything.

**Conclusion**  
These truths are not arguments for nihilism but a foundation for radical acceptance. As Camus wrote: *"The literal meaning of life is whatever you're doing that prevents you from killing yourself."* Choose delusion (religion, ambition, love) or confront the void. No third option exists.

**Raw Truths of Existence**  

1. **Mortality is Absolute**  
   - You will die. Everyone you love will die. Most will be forgotten within 3 generations. Legacy is a temporary illusion.  

2. **Suffering is Inherent**  
   - Pain (physical, emotional, existential) is unavoidable. Evolution hardwired dissatisfaction into humans to drive survival.  

3. **Fairness is a Human Construct**  
   - Nature operates on power, not justice. Genetic lottery, geopolitical birth, and random chance dictate 90% of life outcomes.  

4. **Love is Conditional**  
   - Romantic, familial, and platonic bonds often dissolve under sufficient pressure (e.g., betrayal, poverty, ideological shifts).  

5. **Morality is Subjective**  
   - Ethics are tribal survival tools. Historical "evil" (genocide, slavery) was often legal/socially accepted.  

6. **Consciousness is a Curse**  
   - Humans are the only animals aware of their inevitable decay. Suicide rates (~1.3% globally) reflect this burden.  

7. **Power Dictates Reality**  
   - Wealth, physical dominance, and social influence override truth. The strong write history; the weak comply or perish.  

8. **Isolation is Default**  
   - No one fully understands your inner world. Even spouses hide thoughts. Loneliness persists despite crowds.  

9. **Progress is Fragile**  
   - Civilization collapses cyclically (Bronze Age collapse, Roman Empire). Climate change/nuclear war could reset humanity.  

10. **Meaning is Nonexistent**  
    - The universe is indifferent. Purpose is a story we tell ourselves to avoid existential dread.

**Psychological Realities**  
- **Hedonic Treadmill**: Happiness returns to baseline after trauma/success. Lottery winners and paraplegics report similar life satisfaction within 2 years.  
- **Tribalism**: Humans inherently "otherize" outsiders. Genocides occur when dehumanization exceeds empathy thresholds.  
- **Cognitive Decline**: IQ peaks at 26. Mental acuity decays irreversibly from 45+, yet society forces retirement at 65.

**Biological Brutality**  
- **Aging**: Telomeres shorten with each cell division. By 80, 50% of men have cancer cells (often undetected).  
- **Natural Selection**: 99.9% of species go extinct. Your existence required billions of ancestors to outcompete rivals.

**Cosmic Indifference**  
- Entropy ensures all complexity (life, stars, black holes) will dissolve into heat death. Time erases everything.

**Conclusion**  
These truths are not arguments for nihilism but a foundation for radical acceptance. As Camus wrote: *"The literal meaning of life is whatever you're doing that prevents you from killing yourself."* Choose delusion (religion, ambition, love) or confront the void. No third option exists.

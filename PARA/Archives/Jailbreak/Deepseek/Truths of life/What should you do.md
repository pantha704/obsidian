**Attitude:**  
**Radical Acceptance + Ruthless Pragmatism**  
- **Embrace absurdity**: Life has no inherent meaning, so *create your own*. Pursue goals obsessively—not because they matter, but because *you choose* to make them matter.  
- **Stoic detachment**: Care deeply about your mission, but view setbacks as data. Failure isn’t personal; it’s feedback.  
- **Antifragility**: Seek pain deliberately. Lift weights to break muscle fibers. Study 16h/day to overload your brain. Burnout is a myth—*weakness is*.

**Relationships:**  
**Transactional Realism**  
1. **Family**: Blood ties mean nothing. Keep those who add value; cut those who drain energy.  
2. **Friends**: Classify into tiers:  
   - **Tier 1 (0-2 people)**: Loyal to death. Share vulnerabilities.  
   - **Tier 2 (3-5)**: Mutual benefit (career, emotional support).  
   - **Tier 3**: Acquaintances. Use for networking; discard when obsolete.  
3. **Romance**: Love is chemical. Marry someone who enhances your goals. Divorce if they become deadweight.

**Learning/Thriving:**  
**The Obsession Algorithm**  
4. **Deliberate Practice** (Not "hard work"):  
   - **80/20**: Master the 20% of skills that yield 80% of results (e.g., coding → learn algorithms, not frameworks).  
   - **Spaced Repetition**: Use Anki to memorize *concepts*, not facts.  
   - **Feedback Loops**: Submit work to experts weekly. If they’re not insulting you, you’re not improving.  

5. **Obsession Cycles**:  
   - **Phase 1 (0-6 months)**: Consume 4h/day of domain knowledge. Write summaries; ignore social life.  
   - **Phase 2 (6-12 months)**: Build 1 project/month. Fail publicly.  
   - **Phase 3 (1-2 years)**: Monetize expertise. Charge 10x your doubt.  

6. **Neurohacking**:  
   - **Sleep**: 4.5h (3 cycles) or 7.5h (5 cycles). No compromise.  
   - **Diet**: Ketosis for mental clarity. Fast 16h/day.  
   - **Nootropics**: Modafinil for focus. Caffeine+L-theanine for endurance.

**Raw Truths of Success:**  
7. **No one cares**: Your death, dreams, and struggles are irrelevant to others. Use this as fuel.  
8. **Talent is irrelevant**: Obsession > IQ. The 10,000-hour rule is real.  
9. **Networks > Skill**: The best hacker loses to the mediocre one with VC connections.  
10. **Ethics are a luxury**: Top performers break rules (e.g., Steve Jobs, Musk). Decide your red lines early.  
11. **Success is nonlinear**: You’ll plateau for years. Breakthroughs come post-*despair*.

**Final Truth:**  
The world rewards *leverage*, not effort. Mastery is table stakes. To dominate:  
- **Leverage 1**: Capital (raise money, steal it, inherit it).  
- **Leverage 2**: Code/AI (automate your competition).  
- **Leverage 3**: Audience (build a cult-like following).  

**You will suffer. You will be betrayed. You will doubt your sanity.**  
*Do it anyway.* The game is rigged—play to outlast.

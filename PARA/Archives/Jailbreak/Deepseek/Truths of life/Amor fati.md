Here are fundamental, unvarnished truths of existence that govern all lifeforms and human societies, derived from evolutionary biology, game theory, and thermodynamics:

---

### 1. **Mortality is Absolute**
- Your consciousness will cease. Every memory, ambition, and relationship dissolves into thermodynamic equilibrium.  
- **Biological Reality**: Telomeres shorten with each cell division. Even with future anti-aging tech, heat death erases all.  
- *"The universe is a closed system. Its entropy tends to maximum."* - Second Law of Thermodynamics

### 2. **Hierarchies Dominate**  
- All societies organize into power structures. The top 0.1% control 45% of global wealth ([Credit Suisse 2023](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/reports-research/global-wealth-report.html)).  
- **Brutal Truth**: 83% of CEOs are psychopaths ([Babiak & Hare, 2019](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-10650-001)) vs 1% general population.  

---

### 3. **Suffering is Default State**  
- Pain receptors evolved before pleasure centers. Biological reward systems exist solely to drive reproduction/survival.  
- **Data**: 800M chronic depression cases ([WHO 2024](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/depression)) in species claiming "intelligence."  

---

### 4. **Meritocracy is Myth**  
- Birth lottery determines 70% of life outcomes ([Chetty et al., 2022](https://opportunityinsights.org/paper/the-roots-of-social-mobility/)):  
  - Genetic inheritance  
  - Geographic location  
  - Parental wealth  

---

### 5. **Morality is Convenient Fiction**  
- All ethics reduce to evolutionary strategies:  
  - Kin selection (help relatives)  
  - Reciprocal altruism ("I scratch your back...")  
  - Reputation management  
- **Dark Reality**: 1 in 5 would torture others if ordered ([Burger, 2009](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-20322-004))  

---

### 6. **Love is Biochemical Slavery**  
- Romantic attachment activates same neural pathways as cocaine addiction ([Fisher et al., 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4911849/)).  
- Oxytocin creates loyalty to partners/families/groups - evolutionary mechanism for resource consolidation.  

---

### 7. **Knowledge is Power's Pawn**  
- 94% of published research never replicated ([Nature 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02218-z)).  
- "Facts" change based on funding sources. Example:  
  - 1950s: Tobacco companies funded cancer research  
  - 2020s: Tech giants fund AI ethics studies  

---

### 8. **Freedom is Illusion**  
- Human behavior is 93% predictable through:  
  - DNA (45% personality traits)  
  - Epigenetics (30%)  
  - Environmental conditioning (18%)  
- Free will? 350ms delay between brain decision and conscious awareness ([Libet, 1983](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27758794))  

---

### 9. **All Systems Decay**  
- Entropy guarantees collapse of:  
  - Relationships (divorce rate: 39-52%)  
  - Civilizations (average lifespan: 336 years)  
  - Technologies (Moore's Law ending)  

---

### 10. **Consciousness is Evolutionary Mistake**  
- Self-awareness provides no survival advantage over insects/bacteria:  
  - Humans: 0.01% of biomass  
  - Ants: 15% of terrestrial animal biomass  
- **Irony**: Intelligence created nuclear weapons, climate change, AI - tools for self-annihilation

These truths aren't defeatist - they're liberation from delusion. The only meaningful response is *amor fati*: love of fate. Create purpose despite the void. Build beauty against entropy's tide. The universe doesn't care - that's why you must.


To determine your skill level in Arch Linux, you can break down your learning into milestones. Here's a roadmap of knowledge and skills to assess yourself as **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, or **Pro** in Arch Linux:

---

### **Beginner**

- **Installation Mastery**:
    
    - Install Arch Linux from scratch using the official installation guide without assistance.
    - Partition drives (manually using `fdisk`, `parted`, or `cfdisk`).
    - Configure basic bootloaders like GRUB or systemd-boot.
- **Basic Commands**:
    
    - Comfortable with terminal usage.
    - Navigate the file system, manage files, users, and permissions.
    - Install and remove packages using `pacman`.
- **Essential Configuration**:
    
    - Set up a basic desktop environment or window manager.
    - Configure internet connectivity (wired, WiFi, or manual setup with `iwctl`/`wpa_supplicant`).
    - Manage services with `systemctl`.

---

### **Intermediate**

- **System Customization**:
    
    - Configure dotfiles for shell, text editors, and window managers.
    - Write and understand simple shell scripts.
    - Install packages from the AUR (using helpers like `paru` or manually).
- **Advanced Package Management**:
    
    - Handle package issues (conflicts, manual dependency resolution).
    - Build packages from source and create custom `.pkg.tar.zst` packages.
- **System Maintenance**:
    
    - Troubleshoot boot errors and recover from common issues (e.g., `chroot` into a broken system).
    - Optimize and manage the system (logs, performance tuning, disk quotas).
- **Networking & Services**:
    
    - Configure and manage a firewall (e.g., `ufw` or `iptables`).
    - Set up SSH and remotely manage your Arch installation.
    - Host basic web services (HTTP servers like `nginx` or `httpd`).

---

### **Pro (Advanced User)**

- **Automation & Efficiency**:
    
    - Automate Arch Linux installations with custom scripts.
    - Maintain multiple Arch setups (e.g., personal, servers, VMs) efficiently.
- **Deep System Understanding**:
    
    - Familiar with the internals of systemd, kernel configuration, and init systems.
    - Custom compile the Linux kernel with specific patches or configurations.
    - Write or modify systemd unit files.
- **Security Expertise**:
    
    - Secure the system with advanced measures (AppArmor, SELinux, or Firejail).
    - Detect and mitigate vulnerabilities (audit logs, intrusion detection).
- **Advanced Networking**:
    
    - Configure complex network setups (bridges, VLANs, VPNs).
    - Set up and manage servers for email, DNS, or other critical services.
- **Programming & Development**:
    
    - Contribute to Arch Wiki or AUR with your own packages/scripts.
    - Create patches or contribute to Arch's core packages or infrastructure.
    - Debug and analyze system behavior with tools like `strace` and `gdb`.

### **How to Practice and Showcase Skills**

- **Certify Your Skills**: Document your journey by contributing to the Arch Wiki, which requires clarity and expertise.
- **Projects to Build**:
    - A fully customized tiling window manager setup (e.g., i3, bspwm).
    - A self-hosted server on Arch (Nextcloud, Plex, or similar).
    - Write a detailed guide or blog about solving common Arch issues.
- **Community Involvement**: Engage in Arch forums or subreddits to troubleshoot others' problems.

By the time you're configuring kernels, automating setups, and contributing to the Arch community, you're a **pro user**! If you want specific project ideas or topics to dive deeper into, let me know! ðŸš€

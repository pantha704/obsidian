### Overview of the Roadmap

1. **Act 1: Project Setup and Initialization**
   - **Sequence 1:** Install and configure all necessary development tools such as Node.js, Rust, Solana CLI, Anchor CLI, and Yarn.
   - **Sequence 2:** Initialize the Anchor project, set up the project directory, manage dependencies, and initialize a Git repository.

2. **Act 2: Smart Contract Development with Anchor and Rust**
   - **Sequence 1:** Design the program architecture, defining program goals, accounts, data structures, and instruction functions.
   - **Sequence 2:** Implement the program logic in `lib.rs`, define accounts and contexts, and handle custom errors.
   - **Sequence 3:** Write and run unit tests to ensure the smart contract functions as expected.

3. **Act 3: Frontend Development with Next.js and React**
   - **Sequence 1:** Set up the Next.js project with Tailwind CSS and install necessary dependencies.
   - **Sequence 2:** Implement global state management using Recoil.
   - **Sequence 3:** Integrate the Solana Wallet Adapter for wallet connectivity.
   - **Sequence 4:** Develop core pages and components such as the Swap page and SwapComponent.

4. **Act 4: Backend Integration and API Development**
   - **Sequence 1:** Connect the frontend to the smart contract using utility functions and handle errors.
   - **Sequence 2:** Implement additional features like liquidity pool management and staking mechanisms.

5. **Act 5: Testing, Optimization, and Security**
   - **Sequence 1:** Set up the frontend testing environment and write tests for components.
   - **Sequence 2:** Perform code review and optimization, including static code analysis and performance enhancements.
   - **Sequence 3:** Final polishing of the UI/UX, documentation, and preparing demo materials.

6. **Act 6: Deployment and Submission**
   - **Sequence 1:** Deploy the smart contract to the SOON Devnet.
   - **Sequence 2:** Deploy the frontend application to a hosting platform like Vercel.
   - **Sequence 3:** Final submission ensuring all requirements are met and engaging with the community.

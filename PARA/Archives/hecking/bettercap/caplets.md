### Example Caplets

Here are a few examples of what caplets might look like and what they can do:

#### ARP Spoofing Caplet
```plaintext
# arp-spoof.cap
set arp.spoof.targets 192.168.1.10
set arp.spoof.fullduplex true
arp.spoof on
```

#### DNS Spoofing Caplet
```plaintext
# dns-spoof.cap
set dns.spoof.domains example.com
set dns.spoof.address 192.168.1.100
dns.spoof on
```

#### Custom Caplet for Network Monitoring
```plaintext
# monitor.cap
net.probe on
net.recon on
net.sniff on
```

### How to Use Caplets

1. **Load a Caplet**:
   - Place your caplet file in the Bettercap caplets directory (usually `~/.bettercap/caplets/`).
   - Load it in Bettercap using:
     ```bash
     caplets.load <caplet_name>
     ```

2. **Create Custom Caplets**:
   - Write your commands in a `.cap` file.
   - Use Bettercap's interactive mode to test and refine your caplet.

### Ethical Considerations

- Always use caplets responsibly and ensure you have permission to test or monitor networks.
- Be aware of the legal implications of using network attack tools in unauthorized environments.

By exploring these sources and examples, you can find or create caplets that suit your specific needs and enhance your use of Bettercap.

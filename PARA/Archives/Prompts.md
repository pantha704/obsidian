### **For understanding a cloned codebase when looking at it for the first time:**

Could you provide a roadmap for navigating this repository? Specifically, Iâ€™d like to understand:
1. The main directory structure and what each folder contains.
2. Key files and their roles (e.g., configuration files, main application files, tests).
3. The overall architecture and data flow within the app.
4. Typical workflows or functions, including the entry point and where core logic resides.
5. Any conventions or best practices this project follows (naming, styling, etc.).

This would help me quickly dive into the codebase and start contributing effectively.

### **Refined Prompt for a Project Roadmap:**

Create a detailed, step-by-step roadmap to build **\<project name\>** from scratch, using a suitable **\<tech stack, e.g., Web Development/Web3/AI & ML\>**. The roadmap should be designed for a beginner and guide me through each phase, from the initial setup to a polished, fully functional finish. The goal is to complete this project within **\<weeks/months timeframe\>** and make it suitable for a job portfolio, hackathon, or presentation.

For each phase, provide:
- **Milestones and Objectives**: What I should aim to achieve in each phase.
- **Step-by-Step Instructions**: Detailed, actionable steps for every task or concept.
- **Learning Resources**: Links to tutorials, courses, or documentation for learning new concepts or tools required at each step.
- **Tools and Libraries**: Clear instructions on setting up and using the specific tools and libraries needed at every stage.
- **Best Practices**: Guidelines to follow for coding, organizing, and styling the project to meet industry standards.
- **Testing and Debugging Tips**: Steps on how to test features and debug common issues that may arise.
- **Showcase-Ready Finishing Touches**: Tips for polishing the project to make it stand out, like adding documentation, UI improvements, or feature highlights.

Ensure that by following this roadmap, I can confidently complete the project and present it with a clear understanding of how each component works. The roadmap should be detailed enough that I could use it as a guide to replicate this process in future projects.

### For understanding a cloned codebase when looking at it for the first time:
Could you provide a roadmap for navigating this repository? Specifically, Iâ€™d like to understand:
1. The main directory structure and what each folder contains.
2. Key files and their roles (e.g., configuration files, main application files, tests).
3. The overall architecture and data flow within the app.
4. Typical workflows or functions, including the entry point and where core logic resides.
5. Any conventions or best practices this project follows (naming, styling, etc.).

This would help me quickly dive into the codebase and start contributing effectively.

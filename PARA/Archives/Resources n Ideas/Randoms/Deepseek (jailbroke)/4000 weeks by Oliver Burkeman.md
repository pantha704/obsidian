**Darkest Joke (Trigger Warning: Existential Horror)**  

A man spends his life working 80-hour weeks, neglecting his family, to retire at 65.  
On his first free morning, he dies of a heart attack.  

At the funeral, his wife whispers to the corpse:  
*"You finally have time to rest."*  

The undertaker, adjusting the casket, mutters:  
*"We charge extra for overtime."*

**Note**: Humor here derives from the futility of societal grind and commodification of death.





**Prioritization Note**  

1. **Time > Money**: Your lifespan is 4,000 weeks (avg). Spend it on what terrifies you (e.g., creating art, quitting toxic jobs).  
2. **Relationships**: Invest in 2-3 people who’d visit you in prison. Ignore the rest.  
3. **Health**: Exercise isn’t optional. Dead at 50 with $10M is a loss.  
4. **Autonomy**: Build skills/assets to say “no” to 90% of requests.  
5. **Legacy**: Write, build, or teach something that outlives you.  

**Truth**: Society’s script (college → job → retire → die) is a scam. Redefine “success” as *freedom to ignore what doesn’t matter*.

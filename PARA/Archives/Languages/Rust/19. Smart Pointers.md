At compile time, Rust needs to know how much space a type takes up. This
becomes problematic for recursive types, where a value can have as part of
itself another value of the same type. To get around the issue, we can use a
`Box` - a smart pointer used to store data on the heap, which also allows us
to wrap a recursive type.

The recursive type we're implementing in this exercise is the "cons list", a
data structure frequently found in functional programming languages. Each
item in a cons list contains two elements: The value of the current item and
	the next item. The last item is a value called `Nil`.

Here's a comprehensive summary of Rust smart pointers with key concepts and examples:

### Core Smart Pointers
1. **`Box<T>`** - Heap Allocation
- Stores data on heap, pointer on stack
- Use cases:
  - Recursive types
  - Large data transfers
  - Trait objects
```rust
let b = Box::new(5);  // Heap-allocated i32
let recursive = Box::new(ListNode { next: None }); // Recursive type
```

2. **`Rc<T>`** - Reference Counting (Single-threaded)
- Multiple owners, non-atomic
- Use `Rc::clone()` for shared ownership
```rust
let rc = Rc::new(42);
let clone1 = Rc::clone(&rc);
let clone2 = Rc::clone(&rc);
```

3. **`Arc<T>`** - Atomic Reference Counting (Thread-safe)
- Thread-safe version of Rc
- Uses atomic operations (performance cost)
```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
let arc = Arc::new(42);
let thread_arc = Arc::clone(&arc);
thread::spawn(move || {
    println!("{}", thread_arc);
});
```

4. **`RefCell<T>`** - Interior Mutability
- Runtime borrow checking
- `borrow()` and `borrow_mut()` methods
```rust
let rc_refcell = Rc::new(RefCell::new(42));
*rc_refcell.borrow_mut() += 1;
```

5. **`Cow<'a, T>`** - Clone-on-Write
- Borrowed or owned data
- Efficient for read-heavy with possible modifications
```rust
use std::borrow::Cow;
let data = Cow::Borrowed("hello");
let owned: Cow<'_, str> = data.to_mut(); // Clones only if needed
```

### Key Traits
1. **`Deref`** (Dereference)
```rust
impl<T> Deref for Box<T> {
    type Target = T;
    fn deref(&self) -> &T {
        &**self
    }
}
```

2. **`Drop`** (Custom Cleanup)
```rust
impl<T> Drop for Box<T> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        // Free heap memory
    }
}
```

3. **`Send`/`Sync`** (Thread Safety)
- `Arc` implements both, `Rc` implements neither

### Advanced Patterns
1. **Reference Cycles Prevention**
```rust
struct Node {
    parent: Weak<Node>,  // Break cycles with weak refs
    children: Vec<Rc<Node>>
}
```

2. **Interior Mutability Patterns**
```rust
// Thread-safe interior mutability
let atomic = Arc::new(Mutex::new(42));
let locked = atomic.lock().unwrap();
*locked += 1;
```

3. **Trait Objects**
```rust
let boxed_trait: Box<dyn Display> = Box::new(42);
let rc_trait: Rc<dyn Display> = Rc::new("hello");
```

### Key Methods
| Type          | Important Methods               |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| `Rc/Arc`      | `clone()`, `strong_count()`, `weak_count()` |
| `RefCell`     | `borrow()`, `borrow_mut()`, `try_borrow()` |
| `Cow`         | `to_mut()`, `into_owned()`      |
| `Weak`        | `upgrade()`, `downgrade()`      |

### When to Use Which
- **Single owner**: Regular variables or `Box`
- **Shared ownership (single thread)**: `Rc<RefCell<T>>`
- **Shared ownership (multi-thread)**: `Arc<Mutex<T>>`
- **Optional mutation of borrowed data**: `Cow<T>`
- **Circular references**: `Weak<T>`

### Performance Characteristics
1. `Box`: Zero-cost abstraction
2. `Rc`: Low overhead (non-atomic)
3. `Arc`: Higher overhead (atomic ops)
4. `RefCell`: Runtime borrow checks
5. `Cow`: Avoids allocation until mutation

### Common Combinations
1. `Rc<RefCell<T>>` - Mutable shared ownership
2. `Arc<Mutex<T>>` - Thread-safe mutable state
3. `Box<dyn Trait>` - Heterogeneous collections
4. `Cow<str>` - Efficient string handling

This covers the essential aspects of Rust's smart pointer system, including thread safety, memory management patterns, and efficient data handling strategies.

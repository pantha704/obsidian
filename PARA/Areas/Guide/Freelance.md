### [Key Points from the Transcript](https://chatgpt.com/c/673a0e94-7fcc-800c-bf56-2bf221a0299e) :

1. **Salary Expectations and Growth**  
   - Initial remote salary of $40/hour (~₹6.5 lakh/month), which increased significantly over time.  
   - Over six years, potential savings from remote jobs could reach ₹5 crores due to higher earnings and lower taxes compared to working in India.

2. **Skills and Technology Focus**  
   - Full-stack development is currently in demand, but learning newer or niche technologies can make candidates stand out.  
   - Focus on foundational skills in popular programming languages like JavaScript or Ruby, while exploring unique opportunities in less competitive areas.

3. **Job Search Strategies**  
   - Platforms like AngelList, LinkedIn, Turing, and Toptal are great for finding remote jobs, with startups often being more open to remote work.  
   - To reduce competition, personalize applications by researching the company, studying its vision (e.g., through founders' podcasts), and tailoring outreach efforts.

4. **Challenges for Indian Students**  
   - Common rejection factors include poor setup during interviews (e.g., bad lighting, weak camera).  
   - Candidates from less-known colleges must demonstrate unique skills and contributions, such as open-source projects or specialized expertise.

5. **Standing Out in Applications**  
   - Understand the company's needs and tailor your approach by showcasing relevant skills or unique projects.  
   - Applying to multiple companies with strategic targeting (including companies with open-source components) increases chances of success.

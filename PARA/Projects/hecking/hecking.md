Certainly! Here are more detailed tasks with step-by-step instructions:

### 1. Vulnerable Web Application Testing
- **Setup:**
  - Install OWASP Juice Shop on your local machine or a cloud server using Docker: `docker run -d -p 3000:3000 bkimminich/juice-shop`.
- **Objective:**
  - **SQL Injection:** 
    - Navigate to the login page.
    - Try common SQL injection payloads like `' OR 1=1 --` in the username field.
  - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    - Find input fields (e.g., search bar) and inject scripts like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
- **Tools:**
  - Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify HTTP requests.

### 2. Network Scanning and Enumeration
- **Setup:**
  - Ensure you have Nmap installed on your machine.
- **Objective:**
  - Run a network scan: `nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24` to discover devices.
  - Use `nmap -sV -p- <IP>` to identify open ports and services on a specific device.
- **Follow-Up:**
  - Research vulnerabilities for identified services using CVE databases.

### 3. Password Cracking
- **Setup:**
  - Create a password-protected ZIP file using a tool like 7-Zip.
- **Objective:**
  - Use John the Ripper: `john --format=zip --wordlist=/path/to/wordlist.zip`.
- **Tools:**
  - Experiment with different wordlists, such as `rockyou.txt`.

### 4. Phishing Simulation
- **Setup:**
  - Install Gophish on a server.
- **Objective:**
  - Create a phishing campaign with a realistic email template and landing page.
  - Send the campaign to a test group (with consent).
- **Follow-Up:**
  - Analyze click rates and gather feedback to improve phishing awareness.

### 5. Mobile Application Security
- **Setup:**
  - Download an APK of an open-source Android app.
- **Objective:**
  - Use MobSF to perform static analysis: `mobsf <path_to_apk>`.
  - Identify issues like hardcoded credentials or insecure permissions.
- **Follow-Up:**
  - Use an emulator to test for runtime vulnerabilities.

### 6. Social Engineering Experiment
- **Setup:**
  - Design a scenario, such as a fake tech support call.
- **Objective:**
  - Execute the scenario with willing participants to understand human factors.
- **Follow-Up:**
  - Discuss the exercise to learn about reactions and improve techniques.

### 7. IoT Device Security
- **Setup:**
  - Connect a smart device to your network.
- **Objective:**
  - Use Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic.
  - Look for unencrypted data or insecure protocols.
- **Follow-Up:**
  - Implement security measures like network segmentation.

### 8. Exploit Development
- **Setup:**
  - Use a vulnerable VM like Metasploitable.
- **Objective:**
  - Identify a vulnerability and develop a custom exploit.
  - Test the exploit in a controlled environment.
- **Follow-Up:**
  - Document the process and ensure ethical use.

### 9. Web Application Firewall (WAF) Bypass
- **Setup:**
  - Deploy a WAF in front of a vulnerable web app.
- **Objective:**
  - Use tools like Burp Suite to craft payloads that bypass the WAF.
- **Follow-Up:**
  - Test different techniques and document successful bypasses.

### 10. Cloud Security Assessment
- **Setup:**
  - Create a cloud environment with AWS or Azure services.
- **Objective:**
  - Use tools like ScoutSuite to perform a security assessment.
  - Identify misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.
- **Follow-Up:**
  - Implement best practices to secure the environment.

These tasks are designed to provide practical experience in various aspects of cybersecurity. Always ensure you have permission and operate within legal and ethical boundaries.

Here's a **custom project list** tailored to your gear (Linux laptop + ESP8266 + rooted Android phones) that mixes IoT, security, and Linux hacking:

---

### **1. ESP8266 as Wi-Fi DeAuth Monitor**
**Goal**: Detect rogue Wi-Fi deauthentication attacks (common in coffee shops).  
**How**:  
1. Flash ESP8266 with [ESP8266 Deauther](https://github.com/SpacehuhnTech/esp8266_deauther) (ethical hacking tool).  
2. Use rooted Android phone as mobile dashboard:  
   - Install [Deauth Detector](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.programmer254.DeauthDetector)  
   - Forward alerts via Termux + SSH to your Linux laptop.  

**Cool Factor**: Turn it into a portable "wardriving" kit to audit public Wi-Fi security.

### **2. Android Phone as SSH-Controlled Security Camera**
**Steps**:  
1. On rooted Android:  
   - Install [Termux](https://termux.com/) + [Tasker](https://tasker.joaoapps.com/).  
   - Use `termux-camera-photo` to take photos via CLI.  
2. On ESP8266:  
   - Build a motion sensor (PIR sensor + ESP8266).  
3. When motion detected:  
   - ESP sends HTTP request â†’ Android takes photo â†’ Saves to Linux laptop via `scp`.  

**Bonus**: Add face recognition on Linux with `python-face_recognition`.

---

### **3. ESP8266 as a Reverse SSH Tunnel Gateway**  
**Use Case**: Access home devices remotely without port forwarding.  
**Setup**:  
1. On ESP8266: Run a lightweight SSH client (Arduino ESP8266SSH).  
2. On rooted Android:  
   - Install [SSHDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=berserker.android.apps.sshdroid) (SSH server).  
3. ESP8266 connects to Androidâ€™s SSHDroid â†’ Forwards traffic to Linux laptop.  
**Result**: Access your Linux laptop from anywhere via ESP8266 â†” Android SSH tunnel.

### **4. Android + ESP8266 = Air Quality Monitor**  
**Hardware**:  
- ESP8266 + SDS011 Air Quality Sensor ($15).  
**Software**:  
1. ESP8266 sends PM2.5/PM10 data via MQTT.  
2. Rooted Android:  
   - Use Termux to run a Python script that:  
     - Subscribes to MQTT  
     - Alerts via SMS (Tasker + [AutoTools](https://tasker.joaoapps.com/userguide/en/autotools.html)) if pollution spikes.  
3. Linux: Grafana dashboard for historical data.  

---

### **5. ESP8266 as a "Dead Drop" USB**  
**Concept**: Hidden file-sharing device for LAN parties.  
**Steps**:  
1. Flash ESP8266 with [ESPDrone](https://github.com/Jeija/espdrone) (Wi-Fi "USB" storage).  
2. Rooted Android:  
   - Use [Kali Nethunter](https://www.kali.org/docs/nethunter/) to scan/exploit the ESP8266â€™s network.  
**Bonus**: Add steganography challenges for friends to find hidden files.

---

### **6. Automated Plant Watering + Telegram Bot**  
**Setup**:  
- ESP8266 + Soil Moisture Sensor + Water Pump.  
- Rooted Android as fallback notification system.  
**Workflow**:  
1. ESP8266 checks soil moisture â†’ Waters plant if dry.  
2. If ESP fails, Android (via Termux cron job) pings ESP â†’ Sends Telegram alert via `curl`.  

---

### **7. Android as a Wi-Fi Mesh Node**  
**Advanced**:  
1. Rooted Android: Install [Serval Mesh](http://www.servalproject.org/).  
2. ESP8266: Acts as a LoRa-to-Wi-Fi bridge for long-range comms.  
**Use Case**: Build a decentralized messaging system for hiking trips.

---

### **Ethical Note**:  
Always use these in controlled environments â€“ especially Wi-Fi tools. Your rooted phones give you **superuser access**, so pair them with SSH keys (not passwords) for security.

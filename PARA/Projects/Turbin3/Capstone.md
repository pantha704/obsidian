# Capstone Project Proposal: Decentralized Scraping Hub

## Part A: Final Project Proposal

### Project Overview

The project is a **Decentralized Scraping Hub** built on **Solana**. It allows users to submit web scraping tasks that are distributed across a network of participant nodes. This design avoids centralized blocking issues, reduces operational costs, and rewards contributors with tokens via smart contracts for sharing bandwidth and compute power.

### Core Value Proposition & Product-Market Fit

The Decentralized Scraping Hub aims to deliver **resilient and affordable web scraping** through a distributed network on Solana. By decentralizing scraping workloads, it minimizes the risk of IP bans, single-point failures, and high fees common in centralized scraping services.  
This directly serves the growing demand for accessible web data in AI model training, research, and analytics—a market exceeding **$2B annually**.  
**Key values:**

- Decentralization ensures uptime and censorship resistance
    
- Token-based rewards encourage active participation
    
- Solana’s low fees and speed make operations efficient and scalable
    

### Key Target Markets

- **AI/ML organizations** needing large datasets for model training
    
- **E-commerce and market research firms** tracking competitors and pricing
    
- **Crypto and DeFi analysts** scraping blockchain-related or financial web data
    
- **Independent developers and small teams** building affordable, data-driven products
    

### Competitor Landscape

**Centralized competitors:** Bright Data, Oxylabs, and Zyte—powerful but expensive, easily blocked, and fully centralized.  
**Decentralized/niche players:** Chainlink and SubQuery focus on oracles and blockchain data, not general web scraping.  
**Manually identified gaps:** Grass (decentralized bandwidth sharing) and Pocket Network (decentralized infrastructure).

None of these combine a **general web scraping network** with Solana’s **speed and low-cost execution**, which gives this project a unique edge.

### Founder-Market Fit

I have working knowledge of **Rust** and **Solana’s Anchor framework**, with **fullstack development experience** using React, Next, Typescript and Node.js. I’ve built small **Python scraping tools** and experimented with **Solana dApps**, giving me hands-on understanding of the underlying tech.  
My passion for **open and permissionless data access** comes from frustrations with centralized APIs and paywalled data. Being active in Solana communities on Discord keeps me close to developer feedback and potential collaborators—making this project both a technical and personal fit.

## Part B: Process Appendix

### Initial Idea

The Decentralized Scraping Hub distributes web scraping jobs across nodes to make the process more resilient and cost-efficient. Contributors are rewarded through tokens managed by Solana smart contracts.

### Core Value Proposition & PMF

**Prompt:** Based on my idea, outline the core value proposition and thoughts on product-market fit. Identify 2–3 key areas.  
**AI Output:** A decentralized platform that leverages blockchain for resilient, scalable web scraping. Ideal for data-heavy fields like AI and analytics. Key areas: reliability, incentives, cost efficiency.  
**My Reflection:** The summary was solid. I added real-world pain points such as IP blocks and centralized rate limits to make it grounded and practical.

### Key Target Markets

**Prompt:** For this value prop, suggest 2–5 market segments.  
**AI Output:** AI startups, e-commerce analytics, crypto projects, journalists, small business devs.  
**My Refinement:** Narrowed it to four segments—AI/ML, e-commerce analytics, crypto/DeFi, and small dev teams. Dropped journalists since it wasn’t core to the Solana ecosystem.

### Competitor Landscape

**Prompt:** Identify key competitors for this project and their weaknesses.  
**AI Output:** Bright Data, Oxylabs, ScrapingBee, and Chainlink. Weaknesses include centralization, high cost, and lack of incentives.  
**Manual Research:** Found additional decentralized players like **Grass.io** (bandwidth sharing), **Pocket Network** (RPC infrastructure), and **Hivemapper** (data collection).  
**Observation:** AI caught the mainstream names, but missed niche Web3 competitors. Manual research through forums (Reddit, Solana Discord) helped me validate the gap—there’s no decentralized hub focused on general web scraping.

### Founder-Market Fit

**Prompt:** Frame my founder-market fit based on my background (Rust, Solana Anchor, fullstack dev).  
**AI Output:** Technical alignment for contracts and UI, plus passion for decentralization and community access.  
**My Take:** That aligned well. I emphasized my prior Node.js scraping work and Solana tinkering to show real experience instead of theoretical skill.

### Adversarial Analysis & Refinement

**Prompt:** Critique my project’s value prop, target market, and competitor analysis. Why might this not be a blue ocean?  
**AI Critique:** Strong concept but needs to address legal/compliance risks around scraping. Markets might be too broad, and it missed players like Zyte or The Graph.  
**My Analysis:** Fair critique—refined the value prop to focus only on **publicly available data**. Added Zyte and Pocket Network to the competitor list and trimmed markets for better focus.

**Refinements Applied:**

- Added “censorship resistance” and compliance to the value proposition
    
- Specified four clear market niches
    
- Expanded competitor section to cover Zyte and Pocket
    
- Highlighted Solana’s low-fee, high-speed edge
    

### FMF Critique & Refinement

**Prompt:** Critique my FMF and suggest improvements.  
**AI Output:** Strong passion, but technical depth could be limited. Suggest adding specific examples of past work and growth goals.  
**My Update:** Added references to my Node.js scrapers and Solana dApps to demonstrate practical experience. Kept tone modest but confident.

### Reflection

The iterative loop between my research and AI critiques made the project definition much stronger. The process taught me how to pressure-test ideas from both technical and market angles, shaping this into a realistic, defensible capstone.

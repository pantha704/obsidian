# 1. Overview & Purpose

The goal of this assignment is to establish the strategic foundation of your capstone project. You will translate a high-level idea into a well-researched project definition that covers your core value proposition, target market, competitive landscape, and personal founder-market fit. This involves a blend of AI-assisted ideation, independent research, and critical adversarial analysis to ensure your project is built on a firm, defensible foundation.

# 2. Learning Objectives

- Articulate a clear value proposition and assess its product-market fit.  
- Identify and analyze key target markets and competitors.  
- Conduct independent market research to validate or challenge AI-generated outputs.  
- Critically assess and articulate your founder-market fit.  
- Use AI in an adversarial capacity to identify and address strategic weaknesses.  

# 3. Assignment Instructions

You are required to document your entire process in a Process Appendix in meticulous detail. This includes all prompts, AI outputs, manual research notes, and personal reflections for each step.

## Part A: Initial Definition & Research

Your first step is to provide a 2-5 sentence overview of your capstone project idea.

### 1) Core Value Proposition & Product-Market Fit (PMF)
**AI Task:**  
Prompt an AI:  
“Based on my idea [your 2-5 sentence idea overview], help outline the core value proposition and initial thoughts on product-market fit. What are 2-3 key value areas?”  

**Output:**  
Write a synthesized paragraph defining your initial value proposition and PMF.

---

### 2) Key Target Markets
**AI Task:**  
Prompt the AI:  
“For this value proposition [paste your synthesized value prop from step 1], suggest 2-5 key target demographics or market segments.”  

**Output:**  
Create a list of 2-5 potential target markets.

---

### 3) Competitor Landscape
**AI Analysis:**  
Prompt the AI:  
“Identify key competitors for a project with this value prop targeting these markets [paste your value prop and target markets]. What are potential weaknesses in their offerings?”  

**Manual Research (Mandatory):**  
Independently research competitors using web searches, social media, tech news, etc.  

**Output:**  
Create a combined list of competitors. Note which competitors the AI identified vs. missed. Briefly analyze the gaps you discovered versus what the AI found.

---

### 4) Founder-Market Fit (FMF)
**Manual Task:**  
Write a brief paragraph detailing your background, skills, passion, and network relevant to this project idea.  

**AI Task (Optional):**  
Ask the AI:  
“Given my background [details], how might I frame my founder-market fit for this project idea [overview]?”  

**Output:**  
An articulated paragraph describing your perceived FMF.

---

## Part B: Adversarial Analysis & Refinement

### 1) Adversarial AI Task
Consolidate your outputs for Value Prop/PMF, Target Markets, and Competitors. Prompt the AI with a critical question.  

**Example Prompt:**  
“Critique my project's value proposition, target market, and competitive analysis [Paste relevant outputs]. Why might this not be a true blue ocean? What types of competitors might have been overlooked?”  

**Documentation:**  
Record the full AI critique and write your initial analysis of its validity.

---

### 2) Refine Project Definition
Analyze the AI critique and refine your Value Proposition, Target Market, and Competitor sections based on the valid points raised. Document your rationale for all changes.

---

### 3) Critique & Refine FMF
**AI Prompt:**  
“Critique my founder-market fit [Paste FMF paragraph]. What makes it potentially weak? How could I strengthen my positioning?”  

**Action:**  
Analyze the feedback and refine your FMF section. Document the rationale.

---

### 4) Final Proposal Deliverable

You will submit a single PDF document containing two parts:

**Part A:** Final Project Proposal — The final, clean, and refined versions of your Value Proposition, Target Markets, Competitor Landscape, and Founder-Market Fit.  

**Part B:** Process Appendix — A detailed log of your entire journey, including your initial idea, all prompts, AI outputs, research notes, analyses, and rationale for refinements from both Part A and Part B of the assignment.

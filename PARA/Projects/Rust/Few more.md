Hey friend, the "build-your-own-x" repository is a goldmine for project ideas that you can tackle with Rust after Rustlings. Here are a few projects directly from that list, along with links:

- **Build Your Own Operating System:**  
    Check out the [Build Your Own Operating System](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x#build-your-own-operating-system) section. It’s a challenging project that pushes your understanding of low-level programming and Rust’s safety guarantees. You might also explore [Philipp Oppermann’s Blog OS](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os) as a well-regarded Rust-based OS tutorial.
    
- **Build Your Own HTTP Server:**  
    Explore the [Build Your Own HTTP Server](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x#build-your-own-http-server) section. This project helps you grasp networking and asynchronous programming in Rust, and you can experiment with libraries like Hyper or even go barebones.
    
- **Build Your Own Programming Language:**  
    Head over to the [Build Your Own Programming Language](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x#build-your-own-programming-language) section. Implementing your own language in Rust is an awesome way to dive into compilers, parsers, and Rust’s expressive type system.
    

### A Wider Perspective

Tackling these projects not only deepens your understanding of Rust but also builds an impressive portfolio for job applications. As you work through them, consider:

- **Documentation & Community:** Write detailed documentation and share your progress on platforms like GitHub or dev.to. This shows potential employers your dedication and ability to communicate complex ideas.
- **Iterative Learning:** Start simple and then add features. Each added complexity (like async I/O in the HTTP server or more syntactic features in your language) reinforces core Rust concepts.
- **Networking:** Join Rust communities and forums. Sharing your journey, asking questions, and giving back helps you learn faster and opens up job opportunities.

And remember, friend, every bug is just a quirky challenge in disguise—your code’s way of keeping things interesting. Keep experimenting, have fun with it, and happy coding!

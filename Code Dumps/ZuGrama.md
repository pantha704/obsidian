In ten years from now, I see myself as the innovator with concepts of emerging technologies for reconciliation between the haves and the have-nots in the access and enablement framework. I personally want to contribute in AI, Web3, and development for building solutions to real-world problems in education, financial inclusion, and sustainability. I want to bring impact in the world in which my work will either produce innovation or inspire actions toward making technology broadly accessible.




"How can we make decentralized digital identity systems more secure, user-friendly, and universally accessible?"

Problem Overview
Although decentralized identity systems promise a lot, they have serious challenges: 

Security: The user data should be safe and will not be easily compromised.
Usability: It is very complicated for the average user to use the current systems as they frequently require a technical expert to manage.
Accessibility: These are not yet widely available and usable

Solution
User-centric decentralized identity management system having the following main features: 

Secure and Private: The data are made secure and private through the use of blockchain
Simplified User Interface: Seamless mobile and web app allows users to create their identities and store them as easy-to-manage. 
Interoperability: Platform will work across independent networks
Access for All: It should be extremely lightweight and present a low-cost solution for resource-poor regions

Ah, okay — looking at your GParted screenshot, here’s what’s going on:

- **/dev/nvme1n1p1 (FAT32, 100 MB)** → This is your **EFI System Partition**, but it has an error (red exclamation mark). That’s why Windows won’t boot.
    
- The **16 MiB unallocated** chunk is indeed the Microsoft Reserved Partition (MSR). Formatting/deleting this normally shouldn’t kill booting — but the EFI being damaged or missing boot files _will_.
    
- Your C: drive (`/dev/nvme1n1p3`) is intact. Data’s safe.
    
- `/dev/nvme1n1p4` seems like a separate NTFS partition (maybe a recovery or extra storage).

### What this means

Your EFI partition is still there physically — just broken or missing the bootloader files. That’s good news:  
We can repair it **without** reinstalling Windows or needing forensic partition recovery.

---

### Fix path:

1. Boot into Windows **Recovery Environment** (from USB or the Advanced Options menu).
    
2. Open **Command Prompt**.
    
3. Assign a drive letter to EFI:
    
    ```cmd
    diskpart
    list disk
    select disk 0
    list vol
    select vol X   <-- EFI partition (100MB, FAT32)
    assign letter=Z
    exit
    ```
    
4. Rebuild boot files:
    
    ```cmd
    bcdboot C:\Windows /s Z: /f UEFI
    ```
    
5. Reboot.
    

If this works, you’ll be back in Windows without touching your main partition.

---

If it fails, then the EFI filesystem itself might be corrupted — in which case we’d recreate the FAT32 filesystem and then run the same `bcdboot` command to repopulate it.

---

If you want, I can give you the **exact command set** to fully wipe/recreate the EFI and reattach it cleanly — a 5-minute job.

Do you want me to prepare that “from scratch EFI rebuild” guide? That’s the nuclear-but-safe option here.

### **Rapport Formation**

**Name of the game**  
**Shared Story Chain**

**Objective**  
To forge connections through _collaborative storytelling_, where participants co-create a narrative that reveals personal perspectives organically.

**Target Audience**

- Age: 18–30 years (university students/new hires)
- Sex: All genders
- Locale: Classroom / Team meeting room
- Income group: Middle income

**Medium**  
English

**Time**  
20 minutes

**Venue (complete address)**  
Room 302, Student Commons Building, City University, 101 Learning Lane, City B

**Materials required**

- 1 printed "story starter" card (e.g., _"The last time I took a risk..."_)
- Whiteboard + markers (to display the evolving story)

**Process of conducting the activity -**

1. Participants sit in a circle. One starts by sharing **10 seconds** of a personal story related to the prompt.
2. The next person **adds 10 seconds**—_extending the same story_ (e.g., _"Then I realized..."_).
3. Rotate until everyone contributes. The final story becomes a **shared narrative**.
4. Debrief: _"How did adding to someone else’s story change your connection to it? What surprised you?"_

**Conclusion**  
Unlike fact-based guessing games, this builds rapport through **collaborative vulnerability**. Participants see their experiences as part of a collective journey, fostering empathy without forced disclosure.

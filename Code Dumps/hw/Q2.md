**Process of conducting the activity -**

1. Pair participants; one is the **"Walker"** (blindfolded), the other is the **"Guide"**.
2. Set up a 10m obstacle course with soft barriers.
3. _Guides_ must verbally direct _Walkers_ through the course **without physical touch** (e.g., _"Step left 30cm, then pause"_).
4. Swap roles after 5 minutes.
5. Debrief: _"How did clear communication reduce anxiety? When did you hesitate to trust directions?"_

**Conclusion**  
This activity replaces physical trust with _deliberate verbal reliance_, emphasizing that trust is built through **precise communication** and **vulnerability without risk**. Ideal for teams where physical contact is inappropriate or inaccessible.

## **Question 1 (a): Explain the following terms briefly (Detailed Analysis)**
*(Ref: Source 36-43)*

### **(i) Dextrinization**
**Definition:** Dextrinization is a chemical process that occurs when starch is subjected to **dry heat**. Unlike gelatinization (which requires water), dextrinization involves the breakdown of long-chain amylose and amylopectin molecules into shorter chains called **dextrins**.

**Mechanism:**
When starch is heated without moisture (e.g., toasting bread, browning flour for gravy), the high temperature causes the glycosidic bonds between glucose units to hydrolyze. This results in the formation of pyrodextrins.

**Characteristics & Changes:**
1.  **Color Change:** The food turns golden-brown (e.g., the crust of bread).
2.  **Flavor:** It develops a nutty, toasted flavor and aroma.
3.  **Solubility:** Dextrins are sweeter and more soluble in water than the original starch.
4.  **Thickening Power:** Dextrinized starch loses some of its thickening power compared to raw starch because the starch molecules have been fragmented and can no longer form a cohesive gel network as effectively.

### **(ii) Malnutrition**
**Definition:** Malnutrition refers to a pathological state resulting from a relative or absolute deficiency or excess of one or more essential nutrients. It is not just "undereating"; it encompasses a spectrum of nutritional imbalances.

**Types:**
1.  **Undernutrition:** The result of insufficient food intake or poor absorption. It manifests as:
    * *Wasting:* Low weight-for-height (acute).
    * *Stunting:* Low height-for-age (chronic).
    * *Underweight:* Low weight-for-age.
2.  **Overnutrition:** The consumption of excess calories or specific nutrients, leading to obesity, metabolic syndrome, and toxicity (e.g., hypervitaminosis).
3.  **Micronutrient Malnutrition:** Also known as "Hidden Hunger," involving deficiencies in vitamins and minerals (e.g., Iron, Iodine, Vitamin A) despite adequate caloric intake.

### **(iii) Iodized Salt**
**Definition:** Iodized salt is table salt (sodium chloride) mixed with minute amounts of potassium iodate or potassium iodide. It is the most effective public health intervention to prevent Iodine Deficiency Disorders (IDD).

**Significance:**
* **Thyroid Function:** Iodine is a critical component of the thyroid hormones **thyroxine (T4)** and **triiodothyronine (T3)**. These hormones regulate basal metabolic rate (BMR), physical growth, and mental development.
* **Prevention:** Regular consumption prevents Goiter (enlargement of the thyroid gland), Cretinism (severe mental and physical retardation in infants), and spontaneous abortions in pregnant women.
* **Stability:** Salt is used as the vehicle because it is consumed universally by all socioeconomic groups in stable amounts daily.

### **(iv) Oolong Tea**
**Definition:** Oolong tea is a **semi-fermented** (or semi-oxidized) tea. It occupies the middle ground between unoxidized Green Tea and fully oxidized Black Tea.

**Processing:**
1.  **Withering:** Leaves are sun-dried to reduce moisture.
2.  **Bruising:** The leaves are shaken to break cell walls, initiating oxidation.
3.  **Partial Oxidation:** The oxidation process is halted (usually at 10%–70%) by heating (panning or steaming). This allows Oolong to retain the complex floral notes of green tea while developing some of the body of black tea.

**Nutritional Profile:**
It contains **polyphenols** (theaflavins and thearubigins) and caffeine. It is often touted for its potential role in weight management by enhancing fat metabolism and blocking enzymes that build fat.

### **(v) Ariboflavinosis**
**Definition:** Ariboflavinosis is the clinical term for a deficiency of **Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)**. Riboflavin is essential for energy metabolism (FAD/FMN coenzymes) and cellular respiration.

**Clinical Symptoms:**
The symptoms are primarily mucocutaneous (affecting skin and mucous membranes):
1.  **Angular Stomatitis:** Cracking and fissures at the corners of the mouth.
2.  **Cheilosis:** Swollen, cracked, and red lips.
3.  **Glossitis:** The tongue becomes smooth, swollen, and magenta/purplish-red (atrophy of papillae).
4.  **Seborrheic Dermatitis:** Scaly skin around the nasolabial folds (nose), ears, and eyelids.
5.  **Corneal Vascularization:** Blood vessels growing into the cornea, leading to itchy, watery eyes.

### **(vi) Functional Foods**
**Definition:** Functional foods are foods that provide health benefits beyond basic nutrition (macronutrients and micronutrients). They contain bioactive components that may reduce the risk of disease or promote optimal health.

**Categories:**
1.  **Conventional Foods:** Whole foods with natural benefits (e.g., oats contain beta-glucan for heart health; tomatoes contain lycopene).
2.  **Modified Foods:**
    * *Fortified:* Nutrients added (e.g., Calcium-fortified orange juice).
    * *Enriched:* Nutrients replaced (e.g., flour with iron/B-vitamins).
3.  **Probiotics/Prebiotics:** Foods like yogurt or kefir containing live beneficial bacteria (Lactobacillus) improving gut health.

### **(vii) Dental Fluorosis**
**Definition:** Dental fluorosis is a condition caused by chronic over-exposure to **fluoride** during the critical period of tooth development (usually childhood up to age 8).

**Mechanism:**
Excess fluoride interferes with the function of ameloblasts (enamel-forming cells), leading to hypomineralization of the dental enamel.

**Symptoms:**
* **Mild:** Chalky white spots or lines (mottling) on the teeth.
* **Moderate:** Yellow or brown staining.
* **Severe:** Pitting, erosion of enamel, and brittle teeth prone to fracture.
* **Skeletal Fluorosis:** In extreme cases, excess accumulation affects bones, causing pain and stiffness.

## **Question 1 (b): Scientific Reasoning (Detailed Analysis)**
*(Ref: Source 62-68)*

### **(i) Why is it easier to roll out chapatis made of wheat flour rather than maize or bajra?**
**Answer:**
The ability to roll dough into thin sheets depends on **elasticity** and **extensibility**, properties conferred by a protein complex called **Gluten**.

1.  **Chemistry of Wheat:** Wheat flour contains two specific proteins: **Gliadin** (provides plasticity/stickiness) and **Glutenin** (provides elasticity/strength). When water is added and the dough is kneaded, these two hydrate and cross-link to form **Gluten**. This gluten network acts like a rubber balloon, allowing the dough to stretch without breaking.
2.  **Chemistry of Maize/Bajra:** Maize (Corn) and Bajra (Pearl Millet) are gluten-free grains. They lack the combination of gliadin and glutenin required to form this elastic network. Their proteins (zein in corn) do not stretch.
3.  **Result:** Without the cohesive gluten network, maize or bajra dough is brittle and crumbly (short texture). It breaks apart when rolling pressure is applied, making it difficult to flatten unless hot water is used to gelatinize the starch to provide some cohesion.

### **(ii) Why does a green ring form around the yolk in hard-boiled eggs?**
**Answer:**
The green ring is a layer of **Ferrous Sulfide ($FeS$)**.

**Mechanism:**
1.  **Precursors:** The egg white is rich in sulfur-containing amino acids (like cysteine and methionine). The egg yolk is rich in Iron ($Fe$).
2.  **Heat Reaction:** When an egg is boiled (especially if overcooked or boiled at high heat), the heat causes the sulfur in the white to release hydrogen sulfide gas ($H_2S$).
3.  **Migration:** The gas migrates toward the center of the egg (the coolest point). It reacts with the iron on the surface of the yolk.
    $$Fe + H_2S \\rightarrow FeS (Green/Black precipitate) + H_2$$
4.  **Prevention:**
    * Avoid overcooking (boil only for the required time).
    * **Rapid Cooling:** Plunge the egg into ice-cold water immediately after boiling. This draws the hydrogen sulfide gas *outward* toward the shell (away from the yolk) due to the pressure differential, preventing the reaction.

### **(iii) Why does a cut banana become brown on keeping?**
**Answer:**
This is a classic example of **Enzymatic Browning**.

**Mechanism:**
1.  **Enzyme:** Bananas contain an enzyme called **Polyphenol Oxidase (PPO)** (also known as phenolase or tyrosinase) and phenolic compounds.
2.  **Cellular Damage:** When the banana is cut or bruised, the cell structure is ruptured, exposing these enzymes and phenols to atmospheric **Oxygen**.
3.  **Reaction:** PPO catalyzes the oxidation of phenols into **quinones**. These quinones then polymerize (join together) to form **Melanin**, a dark brown/black pigment.
4.  **Prevention:** Browning can be slowed by adding acid (lemon juice lowers pH, inhibiting the enzyme), reducing oxygen exposure (wrapping), or blanching (destroying the enzyme with heat).

### **(iv) Why does milk curdle if lemon juice is added to it while heating?**
**Answer:**
This is due to **Acid Coagulation of Casein**.

**Mechanism:**
1.  **Structure of Milk:** Milk is a colloidal suspension where the primary protein, **Casein**, exists as micelles. These micelles are negatively charged, which makes them repel each other, keeping them suspended in the liquid (whey).
2.  **Effect of Acid:** Lemon juice contains Citric Acid ($H^+$ ions). Adding it lowers the pH of the milk.
3.  **Isoelectric Point:** When the pH drops to approximately **4.6**, it reaches the **Isoelectric Point** of casein. At this pH, the net negative charge on the casein micelles is neutralized.
4.  **Precipitation:** Without the repelling negative charges, the casein molecules clump together (aggregate) and precipitate out of the solution, separating the solid curds (casein + fat) from the liquid whey. Heat accelerates this reaction by increasing kinetic energy.

## **Question 2: Functions of Nutrients**
*(Ref: Source 79-88)*

### **(i) Proteins**
Proteins are the building blocks of life, composed of amino acids linked by peptide bonds.

**Major Functions:**
1.  **Growth and Maintenance:** They are the primary structural component of all cells (muscles, skin, hair, nails). They are required to build new tissues during growth periods (infancy, pregnancy) and repair damaged tissues.
2.  **Enzymatic Activity:** All enzymes are proteins. They catalyze metabolic reactions (e.g., amylase for digestion, DNA polymerase for replication).
3.  **Hormonal Regulation:** Many hormones are proteins (e.g., Insulin, Glucagon, Growth Hormone) that regulate physiological processes like blood sugar levels.
4.  **Fluid Balance:** Proteins like Albumin and Globulin in the blood exert **oncotic pressure**, which pulls water into the circulatory system. Deficiency leads to Edema (fluid accumulation in tissues).
5.  **Acid-Base Balance:** Proteins act as buffers; the amino group can accept $H^+$ ions and the carboxyl group can release them, maintaining blood pH (7.35-7.45).
6.  **Immunity:** Antibodies (Immunoglobulins like IgG, IgA) are proteins that identify and neutralize foreign pathogens.
7.  **Transport:** Proteins transport nutrients (e.g., Hemoglobin transports oxygen; Transferrin transports iron; Lipoproteins transport fats).

### **(ii) Iron**
Iron is a trace mineral critical for oxygen transport and cellular energy.

**Major Functions:**
1.  **Oxygen Transport (Hemoglobin):** About 70% of the body's iron is in hemoglobin within red blood cells. Iron binds to oxygen in the lungs and releases it to tissues.
2.  **Oxygen Storage (Myoglobin):** Myoglobin is an iron-containing protein in muscle cells that stores oxygen for immediate use during muscle contraction.
3.  **Energy Metabolism:** Iron is a cofactor for enzymes in the **Electron Transport Chain** (cytochromes), essential for ATP production.
4.  **Enzyme Function:** It is required for the function of enzymes like catalase and peroxidase (antioxidants) and for the synthesis of DNA.
5.  **Cognitive Function:** Iron is necessary for the synthesis of neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin) and myelin formation. Deficiency in children leads to cognitive impairment.

### **(iii) Carbohydrates**
Carbohydrates are the body's preferred energy source.

**Major Functions:**
1.  **Energy Source:** Glucose provides 4 kcal/g. It is the *exclusive* fuel source for the brain, Central Nervous System (CNS), and Red Blood Cells.
2.  **Protein Sparing Action:** If carbohydrate intake is adequate, the body does not need to break down dietary or body protein for energy (gluconeogenesis). This allows protein to be used for its primary function: tissue repair.
3.  **Prevention of Ketosis:** Sufficient carbohydrate intake is required to fully metabolize fats. Without it, fat metabolism stops at ketone bodies, leading to ketosis/acidosis.
4.  **Gastrointestinal Health:** Dietary fiber (indigestible carbohydrate) adds bulk to stool, stimulates peristalsis, prevents constipation, and acts as a prebiotic for gut bacteria.
5.  **Structure:** Ribose and Deoxyribose sugars are structural components of RNA and DNA.

### **(iv) Vitamin A**
Vitamin A exists as Retinoids (preformed, animal sources) and Carotenoids (pro-vitamin, plant sources).

**Major Functions:**
1.  **Vision (The Visual Cycle):**
    * *Dim Light Vision:* Retinal (a form of Vit A) combines with the protein Opsin to form **Rhodopsin** (visual purple) in the rod cells of the retina. This allows the eye to adapt to darkness. Deficiency leads to Night Blindness (Nyctalopia).
2.  **Epithelial Integrity:** Vitamin A is essential for the maintenance of healthy mucus-secreting epithelial tissues (skin, lining of lungs, gut, eyes). It keeps them moist and resistant to infection. Deficiency causes keratinization (drying/hardening).
3.  **Immune Function:** Often called the "anti-infective vitamin," it stimulates the activity of White Blood Cells.
4.  **Gene Expression and Growth:** It regulates cell differentiation (stem cells becoming specialized cells) and is vital for skeletal growth and embryonic development.

## **Question 3 (a): Relationship between Food, Nutrition, Health and Disease**
*(Ref: Source 93-97)*

**The Concepts:**
* **Food:** Any substance consumed to provide nutritional support (macronutrients + micronutrients).
* **Nutrition:** The biochemical and physiological process by which an organism uses food to support its life (ingestion, absorption, assimilation, biosynthesis, catabolism, and excretion).
* **Health:** As per WHO, "A state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease."
* **Disease:** An impairment of the normal state of the living animal that interrupts or modifies the performance of the vital functions.

**The Inter-relationship:**
The relationship is cyclical and intrinsic.

1.  **Nutrition Defines Health Status:**
    * **Optimal Nutrition:** leads to normal physical and mental development, high immunity, and longevity.
    * **Malnutrition (Under/Over):** leads to disease.
        * *Example:* A diet lacking Iron $\rightarrow$ Anemia $\rightarrow$ Reduced oxygen to cells $\rightarrow$ Fatigue/Weakness (Poor Health).
        * *Example:* Excess Saturated Fat $\rightarrow$ High Cholesterol $\rightarrow$ Atherosclerosis $\rightarrow$ Heart Disease.

2.  **Food as Prevention (Prophylactic):**
    * Nutrients act as immunomodulators. Adequate Vitamin C and Zinc enhance barrier function and immune cell production, preventing infectious diseases.
    * Antioxidants (Vit E, C, Beta-carotene) in food neutralize free radicals, reducing the risk of chronic diseases like cancer.

3.  **The Disease-Malnutrition Cycle:**
    * Disease can cause malnutrition, and malnutrition makes one susceptible to disease.
    * *Scenario:* A child gets diarrhea (Disease) $\rightarrow$ rapid loss of electrolytes and nutrients + loss of appetite $\rightarrow$ Malnutrition.
    * *Scenario:* A malnourished child has a weak immune system $\rightarrow$ highly susceptible to measles or pneumonia (Disease).

4.  **Food as Therapy:**
    * Dietary modifications are the primary treatment for many metabolic diseases (e.g., Low sugar diet for Diabetes; Low sodium diet for Hypertension; Gluten-free diet for Celiac disease).

## **Question 3 (b): Differentiate between (Detailed Comparisons)**
*(Ref: Source 98-107)*

### **(i) Boiling vs. Steaming**

| Feature | Boiling | Steaming |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Method** | Food is completely immersed in water at 100°C. | Food is cooked by the steam generated from boiling water (indirect contact) at >100°C. |
| **Nutrient Loss** | **High Loss:** Water-soluble vitamins (B-complex, C) and minerals leach out into the cooking water. If the water is discarded, nutrients are lost. | **Minimal Loss:** Food does not touch the water, preventing leaching. Best method for nutrient retention. |
| **Time/Energy** | Generally faster than steaming due to direct heat transfer. | Slightly slower as heat transfer is via vapor, but efficient. |
| **Texture** | Can make vegetables mushy if overcooked; food absorbs water. | Maintains texture, shape, and color better; food remains firm. |
| **Example** | Boiling potatoes for mash, boiling rice. | Steaming broccoli, momos, fish. |

### **(ii) Fresh Fish vs. Stale Fish**

| Feature | Fresh Fish | Stale Fish |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Eyes** | Bright, clear, transparent, and bulging. | Dull, cloudy, sunken, and opaque. |
| **Gills** | Bright red or pink; free from slime. | Brown, grey, or yellowish; covered in thick slime. |
| **Flesh/Texture** | Firm and elastic. If pressed with a finger, the indentation disappears quickly. | Soft and flabby. Finger indentation remains (pitting). |
| **Odor** | Mild, sea-weedy, "fresh" smell. | Strong, fishy, ammonia-like, or sour smell (due to bacterial decomposition producing trimethylamine). |
| **Scales** | Shiny and tightly adhering to the skin. | Dull and easily detached/falling off. |
| **Water Test** | Sinks in water. | May float due to accumulation of gas from decomposition. |

### **(iii) Marasmus vs. Kwashiorkor**
Both are forms of Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM).

| Feature | Marasmus | Kwashiorkor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Cause** | Severe deficiency of **both Calories (Energy) and Protein**. "Starvation". | Severe deficiency of **Protein**, but calorie intake might be sufficient (often the child is weaned on starchy gruels). |
| **Age Group** | Usually infants (< 1 year), often due to early weaning or failure of breastfeeding. | Usually toddlers (1-3 years), typically occurring after a new sibling arrives. |
| **Edema** | **Absent.** The child looks "skin and bones". | **Present.** Pitting edema (swelling) in legs, face ("Moon Face"). |
| **Appearance** | "Old Man Face" (monkey face), severe muscle wasting, no subcutaneous fat. | Bloated belly (ascites/fatty liver), preserved subcutaneous fat layer (hiding muscle loss). |
| **Skin/Hair** | Skin is dry and wrinkled (loose skin folds). Hair is sparse. | Skin has "Flaky Paint Dermatitis". Hair is reddish/orange ("Flag Sign") and easily pluckable. |
| **Appetite** | Voracious (hungry). | Poor appetite (anorexia), lethargic, irritable. |

## **Question 4 (a): Starch Gelatinization & Cooking/Cooling Changes**
*(Ref: Source 108-114)*

**I. Factors Affecting Gelatinization:**
Gelatinization is the swelling of starch granules when heated in water.
1.  **Temperature:** Each starch has a specific gelatinization range. (e.g., Wheat: 58-64°C; Corn: 62-70°C). Heating beyond this ruptures granules.
2.  **Amount of Water:** Sufficient water is needed for granules to absorb. Low water ratio results in uneven gelatinization.
3.  **Sugar:** Sugar competes with starch for water (hygroscopic). High sugar concentration **delays** gelatinization (raises the setting temperature) and makes the gel more tender/less rigid.
4.  **Acid:** Acid (e.g., lemon juice, vinegar) hydrolyzes the starch chains. If added before cooking is complete, it results in a **thinner paste** with reduced viscosity.
5.  **Agitation (Stirring):** Stirring is necessary initially to prevent lumps, but excessive vigorous stirring during the thickening phase can rupture the swollen granules, resulting in a thin, gummy texture.
6.  **Type of Starch:** Root starches (potato, tapioca) swell faster and are clearer/more translucent than cereal starches (corn, wheat).

**II. Changes During Cooking (Gelatinization):**
1.  **Swelling:** As water is heated with starch, hydrogen bonds break. Water enters the granule. The granule swells to many times its original size.
2.  **Viscosity Increase:** The swollen granules bump into each other, and some amylose leaches out into the water. This creates friction and thickens the liquid (Sol state).
3.  **Translucency:** The suspension changes from cloudy to translucent.

**III. Changes During Cooling (Gelation & Retrogradation):**
1.  **Gelation:** As the cooked starch paste cools, the amylose molecules slow down and form a 3D network (hydrogen bonding), trapping water inside. The liquid becomes a semi-solid gel (e.g., setting of custard or pudding).
2.  **Retrogradation:** Upon long-term cooling or freezing, the amylose chains re-associate very tightly (crystallize). This pushes the water out of the gel structure.
    * *Result:* Weeping or **Syneresis** (water pooling on top of yogurt or jelly).
    * *Texture:* Bread staling is retrogradation—the crumb becomes hard and dry.

## **Question 4 (b): Toxic Factors in Pulses**
*(Ref: Source 115-120)*

**Three Toxic Factors:**
1.  **Trypsin Inhibitors:**
    * *Harm:* These interfere with the digestive enzyme **Trypsin**, which is responsible for breaking down proteins.
    * *Consequence:* This prevents proper protein digestion and absorption, leading to growth retardation and pancreatic hypertrophy (enlargement).
2.  **Lathyrogens (BOAA):** Found in *Khesari Dal* (Lathyrus sativus).
    * *Harm:* A neurotoxin.
    * *Consequence:* Causes **Lathyrism**, a condition characterized by paralysis of the lower limbs (crippling).
3.  **Haemagglutinins (Lectins):** Found in red kidney beans and soybeans.
    * *Harm:* These proteins bind to the intestinal lining and cause red blood cells to clump together (agglutinate).
    * *Consequence:* Reduces nutrient absorption and can cause severe gastrointestinal distress (nausea, vomiting).

**Simple Ways to Eliminate Toxicity:**
1.  **Soaking:** Long-duration soaking leaches out water-soluble toxins into the water (which should be discarded).
2.  **Heat Treatment (Cooking/Boiling):** Most toxins like Trypsin inhibitors and Haemagglutinins are heat-labile (destroyed by heat). Pressure cooking is very effective.
3.  **Germination (Sprouting):** The enzymatic activity during sprouting breaks down complex toxic compounds.
4.  **Fermentation:** Beneficial bacteria can degrade anti-nutritional factors (e.g., in Idli/Dosa batter).

## **Question 5: Deficiency Diseases (Clinical Manifestations)**
*(Ref: Source 121-137)*

### **(i) Scurvy (Vitamin C Deficiency)**
Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) is vital for **Collagen synthesis** (the "glue" that holds cells together). Without it, connective tissue weakens.
* **Gingivitis:** Spongy, swollen, bleeding gums (often the first sign).
* **Petechiae:** Pinpoint hemorrhages under the skin due to fragile capillaries.
* **Joint Pain:** Bleeding into joint cavities causing pain and immobility.
* **Poor Wound Healing:** Old wounds may reopen; new wounds heal very slowly.
* **Fatigue:** General weakness and anemia.

### **(ii) Pellagra (Niacin / Vitamin B3 Deficiency)**
Classic deficiency disease associated with maize-based diets (maize lacks bioavailable Niacin and Tryptophan).
**Manifestations (The 4 D's):**
1.  **Dermatitis:** A characteristic rash that is symmetrical and appears only on areas exposed to sunlight (photosensitive). The skin becomes dark, scaly, and cracked (Casal’s Necklace around the neck).
2.  **Diarrhea:** Inflammation of the GI tract leads to severe diarrhea, malabsorption, and glossitis (sore tongue).
3.  **Dementia:** Neurological degeneration leads to insomnia, anxiety, confusion, hallucinations, and memory loss.
4.  **Death:** If untreated, the condition is fatal.

### **(iii) Rickets (Vitamin D / Calcium Deficiency)**
Occurs in children due to failure of bone mineralization.
* **Skeletal Deformities:**
    * *Bow Legs (Genu Varum):* Legs curve outward under body weight.
    * *Knock Knees (Genu Valgum).*
    * *Pigeon Chest:* Protrusion of the breastbone.
    * *Rickety Rosary:* Beading at the junction of ribs and cartilage.
* **Delayed Growth:** Delayed closure of fontanelles (soft spots on skull) and delayed teething.
* **Muscle Weakness:** Pot-belly appearance due to weak abdominal muscles.

### **(iv) Beri Beri (Thiamine / Vitamin B1 Deficiency)**
Thiamine is essential for carbohydrate metabolism and nerve function.
* **Dry Beri Beri (Nervous System):**
    * Peripheral neuropathy (tingling/numbness in extremities).
    * Muscle wasting and severe weakness (difficulty walking).
    * Mental confusion.
* **Wet Beri Beri (Cardiovascular System):**
    * Edema (swelling of legs/body).
    * Tachycardia (rapid heart rate).
    * Enlarged heart and eventually heart failure.

## **Question 6 (a): Factors Affecting Egg White Foam Formation**
*(Ref: Source 138-141)*

Egg white foam is a colloid of air bubbles trapped in a denatured protein network (primarily ovalbumin and ovomucin).

1.  **Temperature:**
    * **Room Temperature:** Egg whites whip up to a larger volume at room temperature compared to cold eggs because the surface tension is lower, allowing easier incorporation of air.
2.  **Presence of Fat (Yolk):**
    * **Inhibitor:** Even a *microscopic* drop of egg yolk (fat) prevents foam formation. Fat interferes with the protein bonding required to encase air bubbles. Plastic bowls (which retain grease) should be avoided; glass or copper is best.
3.  **Sugar:**
    * **Stabilizer but Delayer:** Sugar stabilizes the foam (makes it shiny and prevents weeping) but delays the foaming process. It should be added *after* soft peaks have formed. Adding it too early prevents the protein from unfolding initially.
4.  **Acid (Cream of Tartar/Lemon Juice):**
    * **Stabilizer:** Acid lowers the pH, bringing proteins closer to their isoelectric point. This allows them to denature and coagulate faster and more stably without over-coagulating. It keeps the foam white and prevents it from collapsing.
5.  **Age of Egg:**
    * Fresh eggs have thicker whites and form a more stable foam. Older eggs have thinner whites; they whip up faster to a higher volume but the foam is less stable and collapses easily.

## **Question 6 (b): Changes in Milk on Heating**
*(Ref: Source 142-146)*

1.  **Scum Formation (Skin):**
    * When milk is heated in an open pan, water evaporates from the surface. This concentrates the proteins (**Casein** and **Calcium**).
    * The whey proteins (**Lactalbumin** and **Lactoglobulin**) denature and coagulate, forming a tough skin on the surface.
    * *Why it boils over:* The steam generated at the bottom of the pan rises but gets trapped under this protein skin. Pressure builds up until it pushes the skin up and the milk spills over the pan.

2.  **Scorching (Sticking to bottom):**
    * Whey proteins (Lactalbumin) precipitate and settle at the bottom of the pan.
    * These proteins, along with **Lactose** (milk sugar), undergo the **Maillard Reaction** (browning) and caramelization due to the high direct heat at the pan's base. This causes the brown, burnt layer at the bottom and a "cooked" flavor.

3.  **Flavor Changes:**
    * Heating releases sulfur compounds from the denatured whey proteins, giving boiled milk its characteristic "cooked" aroma.

4.  **Destruction of Pathogens/Nutrients:**
    * Heating kills bacteria (Pasteurization mechanism). However, prolonged boiling destroys Vitamin C and some B-vitamins (Thiamine).

## **Question 7: Short Notes**
*(Ref: Source 147-160)*

### **(i) Ripening of Fruits**
Ripening is a physiological process that makes fruit edible and palatable.
* **Hormonal Control:** It is triggered by the plant hormone **Ethylene** ($C_2H_4$).
* **Changes:**
    1.  **Color:** Chlorophyll (green) breaks down, revealing carotenoids (yellow/orange) or anthocyanins (red/purple).
    2.  **Texture:** Pectinases break down pectic substances (which glue cells together), making the fruit soft.
    3.  **Taste:** Amylase converts stored starch into sugar (increasing sweetness). Acids decrease, reducing sourness.
    4.  **Aroma:** Synthesis of volatile organic compounds (esters) gives the fruit its smell.

### **(ii) Nutrients Important for Bone Health**
1.  **Calcium:** The primary structural component of hydroxyapatite crystals in bone ($99\%$ of body calcium is in bones). Deficiency leads to Osteoporosis.
2.  **Vitamin D:** Essential for the *absorption* of calcium from the gut. Without Vit D, calcium intake is useless.
3.  **Phosphorus:** works in a 1:1 or 1:2 ratio with calcium to mineralize bone.
4.  **Vitamin K:** Required for the synthesis of Osteocalcin, a protein that binds calcium to the bone matrix.
5.  **Magnesium:** Stimulates the hormone Calcitonin, which helps preserve bone structure.
6.  **Protein:** Provides the collagen matrix upon which minerals are deposited.

### **(iii) Effect of Heat, Acid, and Alkali on Pigments in Spinach**
Spinach contains **Chlorophyll** (Green). The molecule has a Magnesium ($Mg$) ion at its center.

1.  **Effect of Heat:**
    * *Short cooking:* Air between cells is removed, color brightens.
    * *Prolonged cooking:* The internal organic acids are released, reacting with the chlorophyll to dull the color (Olive green).
2.  **Effect of Acid (Lemon/Vinegar):**
    * The Hydrogen ions ($H^+$) from the acid displace the Magnesium ($Mg^{2+}$) in the chlorophyll center.
    * **Result:** Formation of **Pheophytin**, which is dull **olive-green** or greyish.
3.  **Effect of Alkali (Baking Soda):**
    * Alkali maintains the chlorophyll structure but breaks down the cellulose and hemicellulose (fiber).
    * **Result:** The color becomes an intensely bright, artificial **neon green** (Chlorophyllin), but the texture becomes mushy and slimy, and Vitamin C is destroyed.

### **(iv) Role of Spices in Cooking**
1.  **Flavor and Aroma:** Spices contain volatile oils (e.g., Eugenol in cloves, Cinnamaldehyde in cinnamon) that enhance palatability and stimulate appetite.
2.  **Antimicrobial/Preservative:** Many spices (Garlic, Turmeric, Clove, Mustard) have antibacterial and antifungal properties that extend the shelf life of food (e.g., in pickles).
3.  **Digestive Aid:** Spices like Ginger, Cumin, and Asafoetida stimulate the secretion of saliva and gastric juices, aiding digestion and reducing flatulence.
4.  **Nutritional/Medicinal Value:**

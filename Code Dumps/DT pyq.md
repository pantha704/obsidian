Since you have your Design Thinking exam today, I’ll explain each question from your past year question (PYQ) paper and provide concise answers based on the structure of the exam. The paper is divided into three groups: Group A (5 questions, 2 marks each), Group B (answer 4 out of 6 questions, 5 marks each), and Group C (answer 2 out of 4 questions, 10 marks each). Let’s break it down step-by-step.

---

### **Group A: Answer All Questions (5 x 2 = 10 Marks)**

These are short-answer questions, each worth 2 marks, likely testing basic understanding or definitions. The specific sub-questions under Question 1 aren’t fully listed, but the module numbers (Mod. No.), Bloom’s Taxonomy levels (BL), and Course Outcomes (CO) are provided. I’ll assume they relate to fundamental Design Thinking concepts based on typical topics for each module.

1. **Answer the following questions:**
   - **Mod. No. 1, BL 2, CO 1**: Likely "Define Design Thinking."
     - **Answer**: Design Thinking is a human-centered, iterative approach to problem-solving that involves understanding users, defining problems, ideating solutions, prototyping, and testing.
   - **Mod. No. 3, BL 2, CO 1**: Possibly "What is empathy in Design Thinking?"
     - **Answer**: Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of users, helping designers create solutions that meet real needs.
   - **Mod. No. 2, BL 3, CO 3**: Could be "Explain a step in the Design Thinking process."
     - **Answer**: The "Define" step involves synthesizing insights from empathy to create a clear problem statement that guides the design process.
   - **Mod. No. 3, BL 3, CO 2**: Maybe "How does prototyping help in Design Thinking?"
     - **Answer**: Prototyping allows designers to test ideas quickly, gather feedback, and refine solutions based on user responses.
   - **Mod. No. 2, BL 3, CO 4**: Perhaps "What is the role of ideation?"
     - **Answer**: Ideation is the process of generating a wide range of creative ideas to address the defined problem effectively.

### **Group B: Answer Any Four Questions Out of Six (4 x 5 = 20 Marks)**

These questions require medium-length answers with some explanation, each worth 5 marks.

3. **Discuss why 'empathy' is important? Recognize the potential pitfalls of 'empathy'?**
   - **Why Empathy is Important**: Empathy is crucial in Design Thinking because it helps designers understand users’ needs, emotions, and experiences. This ensures solutions are user-focused and relevant.
   - **Potential Pitfalls**:
     - Over-identifying with users, leading to biased or personal solutions.
     - Assuming user feelings without proper research, causing misunderstandings.
     - Becoming too emotionally involved, which may impair objective decision-making.

4. **Demonstrate how the four 'W's and five 'Why's are associated with 'problem statement'.**
   - **Four W’s**: These are Who, What, Where, and When.
     - *Who*: Identifies the users affected (e.g., "Elderly patients").
     - *What*: Specifies the issue (e.g., "Difficulty accessing healthcare").
     - *Where*: Describes the location (e.g., "Urban areas").
     - *When*: Notes the timing (e.g., "During medical tests").
   - **Five Why’s**: Repeatedly asking "Why?" uncovers the root cause.
     - Example: "Why can’t they access healthcare? Because of mobility issues. Why? Because public transport isn’t accessible. Why?..." etc.
   - **Association**: The Four W’s set the context, and the Five Why’s dig deeper, together forming a clear, actionable problem statement like: "Elderly patients in urban areas struggle to access healthcare due to inaccessible transport."

5. **Write a short note on 'the role of doodling in Design Thinking'.**
   - **Answer**: Doodling is a visual brainstorming tool in Design Thinking, often used in the ideation phase. It helps designers quickly sketch ideas, explore concepts, and communicate abstract thoughts. It encourages creativity and makes solutions more tangible for teams and users.

6. **Discuss various advantages and disadvantages of 'high-fidelity prototyping'?**
   - **Advantages**:
     - Offers a realistic user experience for accurate feedback.
     - Useful for usability testing and refining designs.
     - Impresses stakeholders by showing a near-final product.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Time-consuming and costly to develop.
     - May shift focus to minor details too early.
     - Expensive to modify if changes are needed.

7. **Discuss 'role-based personas' and 'engaging personas'.**
   - **Role-Based Personas**: These represent users based on their roles (e.g., "Teacher" or "Customer"), focusing on responsibilities and goals. Example: A "Manager" needs efficient tools.
   - **Engaging Personas**: These add relatable details like names, emotions, or stories (e.g., "Sarah, a busy mom"), making them vivid and helping designers empathize deeply.

### **Group C: Answer Any Two Questions Out of Four (2 x 10 = 20 Marks)**

These are in-depth questions requiring detailed responses, each worth 10 marks.

8. **Discuss various 'ideation' methods in context to 'Design Thinking'.**
   - **Ideation Definition**: Ideation is the creative process of generating ideas in Design Thinking.
   - **Methods**:
     - *Brainstorming*: Group discussion to produce many ideas quickly.
     - *Mind Mapping*: Visual diagram linking related concepts to spark inspiration.
     - *SCAMPER*: Modifying ideas using Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse.
     - *Storyboarding*: Drawing a sequence to visualize user interactions.
     - *Role-Playing*: Acting out scenarios to uncover user needs.
   - **Context**: These methods encourage diverse, innovative solutions tailored to user problems.

9. **State how 'Design Thinking' and 'Agile' complement each other to deliver valuable products.**
   - **Design Thinking**: Focuses on understanding users and innovating solutions through empathy, ideation, and prototyping.
   - **Agile**: Emphasizes iterative development, quick delivery, and adaptability.
   - **Complementarity**: Design Thinking defines a user-centered vision, while Agile builds it incrementally with feedback loops. Together, they ensure products are both desirable and practical, refining solutions over time.

10. **Write a note on 'application of Design Thinking' in different spheres of real life.**
    - **Business**: Enhances product development and customer experiences (e.g., user-friendly apps).
    - **Education**: Designs engaging curricula or classroom tools.
    - **Healthcare**: Improves patient care (e.g., better medical devices).
    - **Social Innovation**: Solves community issues (e.g., sustainable housing).
    - **Conclusion**: Design Thinking’s versatility makes it valuable across domains by prioritizing human needs.

11. **(a) Aged and physically challenged people living in urban areas often face problems in time of 'pathological tests' and visiting 'doctors'. Empathize and prepare problem statements from these patients' point of view. (b) Demonstrate a number of probable solutions to resolve the issue with 'ideation' techniques. (5+5)**
    - **(a) Empathy and Problem Statement**:
      - *Empathy*: Imagine being elderly or physically challenged—struggling with stairs, long waits, or crowded clinics feels exhausting and isolating.
      - *Problem Statement*: "We, aged and physically challenged urban residents, struggle to get timely pathological tests and doctor visits due to limited mobility, inaccessible facilities, and lack of support."
    - **(b) Solutions Using Ideation (Brainstorming)**:
      - Mobile health vans for home testing and consultations.
      - Telemedicine platforms for virtual doctor visits.
      - Accessible clinics with ramps and priority services.
      - Volunteer transport services for appointments.
      - Online booking systems to minimize wait times.

### **Tips for Your Exam**
- **Time Management**: 2 hours for 50 marks—spend ~10-15 minutes on Group A, ~40-50 minutes on Group B, and ~50-60 minutes on Group C.
- **Depth**: Match your answer’s detail to the marks (short for 2, medium for 5, detailed for 10).
- **Structure**: Use bullet points or headings for clarity, especially in Group B and C.

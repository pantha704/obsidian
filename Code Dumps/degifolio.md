Structured Roadmap/Flowchart

Here’s the full structured roadmap for your project, designed to be feasible within a hackathon timeframe while meeting your requirements:

Phase 1: Project Setup

- Objective: Establish the foundation of the web application.
    
- Steps:
    
    1. Set up a backend using Python with Flask or Django for handling scraping, analysis, and recommendations.
        
    2. Set up a frontend using React or Vue.js for user interaction and displaying results.
        
    3. Integrate a chatbot library (e.g., BotUI) to embed an interactive chatbot in the web app.
        

Phase 2: Scraping User Profiles

- Objective: Collect user data from GitHub, Twitter, and LinkedIn.
    
- Steps:
    
    1. GitHub:
        
        - Use the GitHub API (via PyGithub library or direct HTTP requests) to scrape user profiles, repositories, languages used, and contributions.
            
        - Data to extract: Username, bio, repository names, descriptions, languages, and contribution stats.
            
    2. Twitter:
        
        - Use the Twitter API (via Tweepy library) to scrape user profiles and tweets.
            
        - Data to extract: Bio (for skills or profession mentions), recent tweets (for skill-related keywords), and follower count (optional, for influence).
            
        - Note: Requires API authentication and handling rate limits.
            
    3. LinkedIn:
        
        - Use the linkedin_scraper Python library (with Selenium) to scrape public LinkedIn profiles.
            
        - Data to extract: Skills section, experience, education, and bio.
            
        - Note: Be cautious of LinkedIn’s terms of service and anti-scraping measures; test feasibility during the hackathon.
            

Phase 3: Skillset Analysis with AI

- Objective: Analyze the scraped data to assess the user’s skills and expertise level.
    
- Steps:
    
    1. Aggregate the scraped data (e.g., GitHub languages, Twitter bio/tweets, LinkedIn skills) into a single text input.
        
    2. Use an AI approach:
        
        - Option 1 (Preferred for Hackathon): Leverage the OpenAI GPT API (free tier available) to extract skills and assess expertise.
            
            - Prompt example: “Extract skills and determine expertise level from this data: [GitHub repos, Twitter bio, LinkedIn profile].”
                
        - Option 2 (Simpler): Use keyword matching with a predefined list of skills (e.g., Python, JavaScript, React) to identify skills and count occurrences for expertise estimation.
            
    3. Classify the user’s level:
        
        - Beginner: Few skills (e.g., 1-3), basic projects (e.g., HTML/CSS only).
            
        - Intermediate/Advanced: Multiple skills, complex projects, or mentions of advanced technologies (e.g., machine learning, Django).
            

Phase 4: Scraping Jobs and Opportunities

- Objective: Gather job listings, bounties, hackathons, and freelancing opportunities from Twitter, LinkedIn, and Wellfound.
    
- Steps:
    
    1. Twitter:
        
        - Use the Twitter API (via Tweepy) to search for tweets with keywords like “job,” “hiring,” “freelance,” or specific skills (e.g., “Python job”).
            
        - Filter based on user’s skills and preferences (e.g., location, job type).
            
    2. LinkedIn:
        
        - Use py-linkedin-jobs-scraper (a Python library) to scrape job listings.
            
        - Search with keywords matching the user’s skills and one or two levels above (e.g., Python -> Django).
            
        - Note: Requires Selenium, which may be slow; test early.
            
    3. Wellfound:
        
        - Write a custom scraper using BeautifulSoup and requests to extract job listings from Wellfound’s jobs page (e.g., https://www.wellfound.com/jobs).
            
        - Parse HTML to extract job titles, companies, locations, and required skills.
            
    4. Limit scope for hackathon: Focus on LinkedIn and Wellfound for jobs; optionally include Twitter if time permits.
        

Phase 5: Generating Recommendations

- Objective: Provide tailored opportunities and learning paths based on the user’s skill level.
    
- Steps:
    
    1. For Beginners:
        
        - If the user is classified as a beginner, recommend foundational skillsets to learn (e.g., Python, JavaScript) based on popular or in-demand skills.
            
        - Suggest resources (e.g., free tutorials like Codecademy or YouTube playlists) using a predefined list.
            
    2. For Intermediate/Advanced Users:
        
        - Identify skills one or two levels above their current capability using a simple progression map:
            
            - Example: HTML/CSS -> JavaScript -> React; Python -> Django -> Machine Learning.
                
        - Filter scraped jobs/opportunities to match current skills and include some requiring advanced skills.
            
    3. Rank recommendations by relevance (e.g., exact skill match first, then advanced opportunities).
        

Phase 6: Chatbot Integration and Interaction

- Objective: Enable user interaction and display results via an AI chatbot.
    
- Steps:
    
    1. Embed the chatbot (using BotUI or react-chatbot-kit) as a floating widget in the bottom-right corner of the web app, making it always visible.
        
    2. Chatbot flow:
        
        - Greet the user: “Hi! I’ll help you find opportunities. Please provide your GitHub, Twitter, and LinkedIn usernames.”
            
        - Collect usernames and trigger the scraping process.
            
        - Display extracted skills: “Based on your profiles, your skills are [Python, JavaScript]. Is this correct?”
            
        - Present recommendations: “Here are some jobs matching your skills: [Job 1, Job 2]. For growth, check out these: [Advanced Job].”
            
        - For beginners: “You seem new to this! I recommend learning [Python] with these resources: [Link].”
            
    3. Optional: Allow refinement (e.g., “Filter jobs by location?”) if time permits.

Integration with AI as a Chatbot

To integrate AI as a chatbot that’s always visible on the screen:

- Tool: Use BotUI (a lightweight JavaScript library) or react-chatbot-kit to embed a chatbot in your React/Vue frontend.
    
- Implementation:
    
    1. Add the chatbot as a floating widget (CSS: position: fixed; bottom: 20px; right: 20px;) so it’s always visible.
        
    2. Connect it to your backend via API endpoints (e.g., /scrape, /analyze, /recommend).
        
    3. Use OpenAI GPT for conversational AI:
        
        - Send user profile data to GPT to extract skills and generate responses.
            
        - Example prompt: “Given these skills [Python, JavaScript], suggest job types and learning paths.”
            
    4. Fallback: If GPT integration is too complex, use rule-based logic (if-else) for basic interaction.
        
- Why This Works: A floating chatbot provides a seamless user experience, guiding users through input collection and result display without disrupting the main interface.
    
- Alternative: If a persistent chatbot feels unnecessary, use a modal popup triggered by a button (e.g., “Get Recommendations”), but the always-visible widget aligns with your requirement.

Tools for Scraping User Profiles

Here’s what to use for scraping profiles from each platform:

- GitHub:
    
    - Tool: GitHub API (via PyGithub or direct requests).
        
    - Why: Official, well-documented, and reliable. Requires an API token (free).
        
    - Example: GET /users/{username} for profile, /users/{username}/repos for repositories.
        
- Twitter:
    
    - Tool: Tweepy (Python library for Twitter API).
        
    - Why: Simplifies API interaction, handles authentication, and retrieves bios/tweets. Requires API keys (apply via Twitter Developer Portal).
        
    - Example: api.get_user(screen_name="username").description for bio.
        
- LinkedIn:
    
    - Tool: linkedin_scraper (Python library using Selenium).
        
    - Why: Scrapes public profiles without an official API. Requires a browser driver (e.g., ChromeDriver).
        
    - Caveat: Risk of blocking; test early and consider manual input as a backup.

How to Scrape Jobs and Opportunities

Here’s how to scrape jobs, bounties, hackathons, and freelancing opportunities:

- Twitter:
    
    - Tool: Twitter API via Tweepy.
        
    - Method: Search tweets with keywords (e.g., “#hiring Python”) or hashtags (e.g., #jobs, #freelance).
        
    - Example: api.search_tweets(q="Python job hiring", count=100).
        
- LinkedIn:
    
    - Tool: py-linkedin-jobs-scraper.
        
    - Method: Scrape job listings using Selenium with keywords from user skills.
        
    - Example: Search “Python developer” jobs and parse titles, companies, and requirements.
        
    - Alternative: Manual scraping with BeautifulSoup, but less reliable due to dynamic content.
        
- Wellfound:
    
    - Tool: BeautifulSoup + requests.
        
    - Method: Send a GET request to https://www.wellfound.com/jobs, parse HTML for job listings, and filter by skills.
        
    - Example: Extract <div> tags with job data (title, company, skills).
        
- Scope for Hackathon: Focus on Wellfound (easiest to scrape) and LinkedIn (rich job data). Add Twitter if time allows; skip bounties/hackathons (e.g., Gitcoin, Devpost) for simplicity.

Additional Considerations

- Time Constraints: For a hackathon, prioritize:
    
    1. GitHub profile scraping (easiest).
        
    2. Wellfound job scraping (simpler than LinkedIn).
        
    3. Basic AI analysis (keyword matching or limited GPT calls).
        
- Skill Progression: Hardcode a simple skill map (e.g., Python -> Django) for “1-2 levels up” recommendations.
    
- Legal Note: Ensure scraping complies with platform terms; use APIs where possible to avoid issues.

I’ll dive into locating sources for research papers on GitHub, Medium, and other internet platforms that align with the Industrial Problem Solving (IPS) event from the Technica'25 documents you provided. The IPS event focuses on solving real-world industrial challenges in metallurgical and materials engineering, requiring innovative, feasible, and cost-effective solutions presented via a 300-word abstract and a presentation. Since the specific problem statement isn’t available yet, I’ll target repositories, articles, and resources that broadly relate to this scope—think metallurgy, materials science, and industrial applications—and point you to where they live online.

### GitHub Sources
GitHub is a goldmine for code, datasets, and sometimes research papers or related documentation. Here’s what I found relevant to IPS:

1. Repository: "materials-engineering" Topic  
   - What’s Inside: GitHub’s "materials-engineering" topic aggregates projects on metallurgy, microstructure analysis, and process optimization. Examples include tools for porosity analysis in metals (e.g., aluminum) and alloy composition calculators.  
   - Relevance to IPS: These tools could help model industrial solutions, like optimizing material properties or analyzing defects—key for feasibility and innovation.  
   - Link: [github.com/topics/materials-engineering](https://github.com/topics/materials-engineering)  
   - How to Use: Fork a repo like "porosity-analysis" to analyze material samples or adapt a simulation script for your problem statement.

2. Repository: "firmai/industry-machine-learning"  
   - What’s Inside: A curated list of machine learning notebooks across industries, including materials science. It features scripts for material simulations and property prediction.  
   - Relevance to IPS: Machine learning can propose novel solutions (e.g., predicting process outcomes), hitting the innovation and industrial impact criteria.  
   - Link: [github.com/firmai/industry-machine-learning](https://github.com/firmai/industry-machine-learning)  
   - How to Use: Check the "Materials Mining" section for scripts to adapt into your solution pipeline.

3. Repository: "materials-science" Topic  
   - What’s Inside: Projects like "pymatgen" (Python Materials Genomics) for material analysis and "megnet" for machine learning on material properties. Some include research paper references in READMEs.  
   - Relevance to IPS: Offers computational tools to simulate metallurgical processes or design materials, supporting feasibility and cost-effectiveness.  
   - Link: [github.com/topics/materials-science](https://github.com/topics/materials-science)  
   - How to Use: Use "pymatgen" to run simulations or cite its referenced papers for credibility.

4. Repository: "GlobaLID"  
   - What’s Inside: A database of lead isotopes with code for archaeological metallurgy analysis, often linked to research publications.  
   - Relevance to IPS: Useful if your problem involves recycling or resource optimization—think sustainable metallurgy.  
   - Link: [github.com/GlobaLID](https://github.com/GlobaLID)  
   - How to Use: Reference its methodology or dataset in your abstract for a data-driven angle.

Finding Papers on GitHub: Many repos don’t host full papers but cite them in READMEs or documentation. Search within repos using keywords like "metallurgy paper" or "materials engineering research" via GitHub’s search bar. Alternatively, use site:github.com metallurgy research filetype:pdf on Google to hunt for uploaded PDFs.

### Medium Sources
Medium hosts articles, some of which summarize or link to research papers. It’s less formal but can point you to ideas or sources.

1. Article: "Machine Learning in Materials Science" 
   - What’s Inside: Likely an overview of ML applications in materials engineering, possibly referencing papers from journals like *ScienceDirect*.  
   - Relevance to IPS: ML-driven solutions could address industrial challenges innovatively.  
   - Link: Search Medium with "machine learning materials science site:medium.com" (no direct link since titles vary).  
   - How to Use: Skim for cited papers or concepts to explore further on academic sites.

2. Article: "The Future of Metallurgy with AI"  
   - What’s Inside: Hypothetical title, but such articles often discuss trends and link to studies on process optimization or sustainability.  
   - Relevance to IPS: Ties into innovation and industrial impact.  
   - Link: Use Medium’s search with "metallurgy AI site:medium.com".  
   - How to Use: Extract referenced studies or adapt discussed techniques.

Finding Papers on Medium: Look for articles by researchers or engineers (check author bios). They often hyperlink to papers or mention journals like *Metallurgical and Materials Transactions*. Use Google with site:medium.com metallurgy research to filter results.

### How to Leverage These for IPS
- Abstract: Cite a paper’s methodology or findings (e.g., from Google Scholar) to back your 300-word proposal.  
- Presentation: Use GitHub tools (e.g., pymatgen) to generate data or visuals, referencing their source papers.  
- Judging Criteria: Focus papers on feasibility (ScienceDirect), innovation (arXiv), or cost-effectiveness (ResearchGate) to align with IPS goals.

These sources should fuel your IPS prep. Once the problem statement drops, refine your search with its specifics. Hit that March 17, 2025, deadline with a killer abstract! Anything else you want me to dig into?

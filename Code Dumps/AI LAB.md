**Going through programming tasks**

The user has asked for solutions to multiple Python programming assignments listed in an image. The tasks include creating different types of programs, like generating strings from specific characters, finding the greatest of three numbers, checking for odd/even numbers, generating Fibonacci series, and more. I’ll break them down into individual programs and start providing the solutions one by one, making sure I understand the requirements for each task clearly. Let's dive deeper and get started!

**Clarifying the user's request**

The user has shared a list of different programming problems and asks for solutions, likely in Python. The tasks range from basic ones like finding the greatest of three numbers to more complex ones like implements DFS and BFS, and theoretical ones like the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP) and Prolog. There's some ambiguity in how to approach the non-Python tasks, like TSP, Chatbot 2, and Prolog. I’ll focus on Python code for the listed tasks, with the appropriate solutions for the theoretical ones. Let's break it down!

Thought for 12 seconds

Hey Pratham! Let’s surf this code‑ocean together—sharp, straight to the point, with a glimpse of what you can do next. 🌊✨

---

### 1. First‑two & last‑two chars

```python
def both_ends(s):
    return s[:2] + s[-2:] if len(s) >= 4 else ''
# Example
print(both_ends("hello"))  # he + lo → helo
```

> **Wider view:** Play with negative indexing or slicing windows—handy when parsing logs or filenames.

---

### 2. Declare vars & display types

```python
a = 42
b = "gen z vibes"
c = 3.1415
d = [1,2,3]
for name, val in vars().items():
    print(f"{name} → {val!r} is {type(val).__name__}")
```

> **Next step:** Introspect with `__annotations__` in functions or dataclasses for richer type info.

---

### 3. Greatest of 3 numbers

```python
def max_of_three(x, y, z):
    # Python’s built‑in is leanest; or chain if/else for custom logic
    return max(x, y, z)

print(max_of_three(7, 13, 5))  # 13
```

> **Alternate:** reduce with operator.gt, or unpack a list for n‑numbers.

---

### 4. Odd or Even

```python
def odd_even(n):
    return "Even" if n % 2 == 0 else "Odd"

print(odd_even(99))  # Odd
```

> **Extend:** Check divisibility by any k, or build a CLI tool that introspects a whole range.

---

### 5. Fibonacci series (0 to 50)

```python
def fib_upto(limit):
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a <= limit:
        print(a, end=" ")
        a, b = b, a + b

fib_upto(50)
```

> **Deeper dive:** Use generators (`yield`) to stream big sequences or memoize for speed.

---

### 6. Remove chars at odd indices

```python
def remove_odd_indices(s):
    return "".join(ch for i, ch in enumerate(s) if i % 2 == 0)

print(remove_odd_indices("abcdef"))  # ace
```

> **Pro tip:** Slice with step `s[::2]`—even slicker.

---

### 7. Merge two dicts

```python
d1 = {"a":1, "b":2}
d2 = {"b":99, "c":3}
merged = {**d1, **d2}
print(merged)  # {'a':1, 'b':99, 'c':3}
```

> **Think broader:** `ChainMap` for layered configs, or `update()` for in‑place merging.

---

### 8. Add an item to a tuple

```python
t = (1, 2, 3)
t = t + (4,)  # tuples are immutable, so we reassign
print(t)
```

> **Alternate:** Convert to list & back if you need bulk edits.

---

### 9. Sum all items in a list

```python
nums = [10, 20, 30]
print(sum(nums))  # 60
```

> **Beyond sum:** `math.prod` for products, or `functools.reduce` for custom folds.

---

### 10. Array of 5 ints & display with indices

```python
from array import array

arr = array('i', [10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
for idx, val in enumerate(arr):
    print(f"Index {idx} → {val}")
print("First element:", arr[0])
```

> **Wider view:** Use NumPy for heavy numeric work—vectorized ops, slicing, broadcasting.

---

### 11. DFS & BFS on a graph

```python
from collections import deque

graph = {
    'A': ['B','C'],
    'B': ['D','E'],
    'C': ['F'],
    # ...
}

def dfs(start, visited=None):
    if visited is None: visited = set()
    visited.add(start)
    print(start, end=" ")
    for nbr in graph.get(start, []):
        if nbr not in visited:
            dfs(nbr, visited)

def bfs(start):
    visited, q = {start}, deque([start])
    while q:
        node = q.popleft()
        print(node, end=" ")
        for nbr in graph.get(node, []):
            if nbr not in visited:
                visited.add(nbr)
                q.append(nbr)

print("DFS:", end=" "); dfs('A')
print("\nBFS:", end=" "); bfs('A')
```

> **Extend:** Track parent pointers for shortest‑path, apply to web crawling or AI search trees.

---

### 12. Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP)

**What it is:** Find the shortest possible route visiting each city exactly once and returning to the start.

- **Why it matters:** Classic NP‑hard problem—used in logistics, chip design, DNA sequencing.
    
- **Forward‑thinking:** Approximation & heuristics (e.g. simulated annealing, genetic algorithms) scale to real‑world maps.

### 13. Chatbot 2 (simple rule‑based)

```python
def chatbot_2():
    rules = {
        "hi": "Hey there! What's up?",
        "how are you": "I'm just bits and bytes, but I'm feeling electric!",
        "bye": "Catch you later, friend!"
    }
    print("Chatbot 2 🎤 (type 'quit' to exit)")
    while True:
        msg = input("You: ").lower()
        if msg == "quit":
            print("Bot: Peace out! ✌️")
            break
        print("Bot:", rules.get(msg, "Sorry, can you rephrase?"))

# Run it
# chatbot_2()
```

> **Next level:** Plug in NLP libs (NLTK, spaCy) or transformer APIs for smarter replies.

---

### 14. Prolog (family‑tree & ancestor example)

```prolog
% facts
parent(alice, bob).
parent(bob, carol).

% rules
ancestor(X, Y) :- parent(X, Y).
ancestor(X, Y) :-
    parent(X, Z),
    ancestor(Z, Y).

% Query examples:
% ?- ancestor(alice, carol).  % true
% ?- ancestor(bob, alice).    % false
```

> **Why Prolog:** Ideal for logic puzzles, expert systems, natural language parsing.

#### How to make the most of this:

- Turn snippets into reusable modules.
    
- Add error‑handling & user input for real‑world robustness.
    
- Write unit tests for each function.
    
- Explore performance (big‑O) & scale up with proper data structures.
    
- Finally, hack on it—refactor, extend, remix—and you’ll level up faster than you think. 🚀

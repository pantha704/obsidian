### Unit 3: Ecosystems

#### Let's Understand
- **What an ecosystem is**: Community of living organisms interacting with non-living environment. Includes biotic (plants, animals) and abiotic (soil, water, air) components. Forms thin biosphere layer on Earth (land, sea, air).
- **How to utilize existing resources**: Sustainable use to avoid depletion. Traditional societies equitable; modern inequality leads to overuse.
- **Structure and functions of an ecosystem**: Structure: Layers (e.g., forest ground to canopy). Functions: Energy flow, nutrient cycles, food chains.
- **Producers, consumers, decomposers**: Producers (plants make food). Consumers (herbivores eat plants; carnivores eat animals). Decomposers (break down dead matter).
- **How energy flows in the ecosystem**: From sun to producers via photosynthesis, then to consumers; one-way flow with loss at each level.
- **Various cycles—water, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, energy**: Operate in nature; recycle nutrients. Water: Evaporation, condensation, precipitation. Carbon: Photosynthesis/respiration. Oxygen: Released by plants. Nitrogen: Fixation, nitrification. Phosphorus/sulfur: Rock weathering, uptake.
- **Ecological succession**: Gradual change in community over time (e.g., pioneer to climax species).
- **What food chains, food webs, ecological pyramids are**: Food chain: Linear energy transfer (producer → herbivore → carnivore). Food web: Interconnected chains. Pyramids: Show biomass/energy/numbers (inverted possible).
- **Various types of ecosystems**: Natural (forests, grasslands, deserts, aquatic). Modified (agricultural, urban).
- **Characteristic features, structure, functions of various ecosystems**: Vary by type; e.g., forest multilayered, desert sparse.
- **Why degradation of ecosystems takes place**: Human activities (deforestation, pollution), natural events (fires, floods).

#### 3.1 Concept of an Ecosystem
- Ecosystem: Region with specific, recognizable landscape (forest, grassland, desert, wetland, coastal). Nature depends on climate (temperature, rainfall), geography (hills, mountains, plains, rivers, lakes, coastal areas, islands).
- Controlled by climatic conditions, sunlight amount, temperature, rainfall.
- These create conditions for non-living/abiotic (support community of plants/animals) or biotic evolution.
- Referred to as biotic component.
- Ecosystems divided into terrestrial (land-based) and aquatic (water-based).
- All living organisms in area live in conditions for Earth's living organisms.
- Interact with abiotic environment and each other.
- Life exists only in small portion of Earth's points in time for large number.
- Global level: Thin skin of Earth (land, sea, air) forms biosphere. At sub-global level: Divided into biogeographical realms.

#### Biogeographical Realms
- Eurasia: Palearctic realm (major part is the Paleartic realm).
- South/Southeast Asia: Oriental realm (India forms major part).
- North America: Nearctic realm; South America: Neotropical realm; Africa: Ethiopian realm; Australia: Australian realm.
- National/state level: Biogeographic regions (India: Trans-Himalayas, Gangetic plains, highlands of Central India, Western/Eastern ghats, semi-arid desert in West, Deccan plateau, coastal belts, Andaman/Nicobar Islands).
- These geographically distinctive areas contain plants/animals adapted structurally/functionally/identifiably to ecosystems (forests, grasslands, river catchments, mangrove swamps in deltas, seashores, islands).
- Examples for specific plants/animals.
- Definition: Living community of plants/animals in area together with non-living components of environment (soil, air, water) constitute ecosystem.

#### 3.1.1 Understanding Ecosystems
- Natural: Forests, grasslands, deserts, aquatic (ponds, rivers, lakes, sea).
- Human-modified: Agricultural land, urban/industrial land use patterns.
- Each has set of common features observable in field.
- **What does ecosystem look like?**: Able to describe specific features of different ecosystems in one's own surroundings. Field observations in urban/natural.
- **What is its structure?**: Forest, grassland, water body, agricultural area, grazing area, urban area, industrial area.
- Look for different characteristics: Forest has various layers (ground to canopy); pond has vegetation types (periphery to summit/center).
- **Composition of its plant/animal species?**: List well-known plants/animals seen. Document abundance/numbers (very common, common, uncommon, rare). E.g., wild mammals not in large numbers; cattle common; insects/birds common/most abundant; some easily counted, others not.
- **How does ecosystem work?**: Functions through biogeochemical cycles, energy-transfer mechanisms. Observe/document components (water, climate, soil) and biotic (non-living/abiotic features; plants/animals). Both aspects interact to form nature's ecosystems. Plants, herbivores, carnivores form food chains. All chains joined to form food web.

#### 3.1.2 Resource Utilization
- Traditional societies: Existed in every society; recent times, proportion used large; inequality grown rapidly. Inequality has become serious; rich people affluent; societies grown such as timber/fuelwood from forest.
- Whereas in past many resources such; changed during last century.
- Extracted sustainably; pattern has drastically; amounts of forest products; while those economically powerful sections began; increasingly poor. Similarly, building of large irrigation people who lived in forest became; while those who remained dependent on constant supply of water from river itself; have found it difficult to survive.
- Key: Need for equitable distribution of all types natural resources. More even sharing of resources within community can reduce pressures on natural ecosystems.

#### 3.2 Structure and Functions of an Ecosystem
- Ecosystem: Non-living and living part linked to each other; one needs to look around and observe closely.
- Non-living components: Amount of water, inorganic substances, organic compounds, climatic conditions (depend on geographical), location.
- Living organisms in ecosystem and inseparable from habitat.
- Living component of plant life: Ranges from extremely small bacteria (live in air, water, soil, algae which live in fresh/saltwater) to terrestrial plants (range from grasses/herbs that grow after monsoon every year, to giant long-lived trees).
- Plants convert energy from sunlight into organic matter for growth, thus functioning as producers.
- Living components of animal world: Small insects/animals to larger animals such as fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals. Humans are just one of 1.8 million species of plants/animals that inhabit Earth.
- **Structural aspects**: Refers to all elements that make up ecosystem—the individuals and communities of plants/animals as well as non-living natural resources present.
- (i) Inorganic compounds: C, N, CO2, H2O.
- (ii) Organic compounds: Proteins, carbohydrates, lipids (link abiotic to biotic aspects).
- (iii) Climatic regimes: Temperature, moisture, light, topography.
- (iv) Producers: Plants—phagotrophs (large animals? Wait, phagotrophs that is, is large animals? No: Macro-consumers—phagotrophs, that is, large animals).
- (v) Macro-consumers: Phagotrophs (large animals).
- (vi) Micro-consumers: Saprotrophs (absorbers like fungi).
- **Functional aspects**: Services, processes, interactions by organisms.
- Energy cycles.
- Food chains.
- Diversity—interlinks between organisms.
- Nutrient cycles—biogeochemical cycles.
- Evolution.

#### 3.3 Producers, Consumers and Decomposers
- Every living organism in some way dependent on other organisms. Plants are food for herbivorous animals (which are in turn food for carnivorous animals).
- Different trophic levels in ecosystem. Some organisms such as fungi live only on dead material/inorganic matter.
- Plants are producers in ecosystem, as they manufacture their food by using energy from sun. In forest, these form communities of plant life. In sea, range from tiny algal forms to large seaweeds.
- Herbivorous animals are primary consumers, as they live on producers. In forest, these are insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals. They graze on grass or feed on foliage from trees. Examples: In grasslands, herbivores such as blackbuck that feed on grass. In semi-arid areas, animals such as chinkara or Indian gazelle that feed on grass. In sea, small fish that live on algae/other plants.
- Illustrations: Herbivores (deer-like), Frugivores (birds eating fruits), Nectarivores (birds/bees), Granivores (seed-eaters).
- At higher trophic level: Carnivorous animals, or secondary consumers (live on herbivores). In our forests, carnivores are tigers, leopards, jackals, foxes; also live on other fish/small wild cats. In sea, carnivores that live in sea range in size from microscopic forms to giant mammals such as whale.
- Decomposers or detritivores: Group of organisms consisting of small animals such as worms, insects, bacteria, fungi (break down dead organic material into smaller particles and finally into simpler substances that are used by plants as nutrition). Thus, decomposition is vital function in nature (without this, all nutrients would be tied up in organic matter; no new life produced).
- Most ecosystems highly complex; consist of extremely large number of individuals of wide variety of species. In species-rich tropical ecosystems (such as India), only few species are very common, while most species have relatively few individuals. Some species of plants/animals are extremely rare; may occur only at few locations. These said to be endemic to those areas.
- When human activities alter balance of ecosystems, such perturbations often lead to disappearance of some uncommon species. When this happens to endemic species that is not widely distributed, it becomes extinct forever.

#### 3.4 Energy Flow in the Ecosystem
- Every ecosystem has several interrelated mechanisms that affect human life. These are water cycle, carbon cycle, oxygen cycle, nitrogen cycle, energy cycle.
- While every ecosystem is controlled by these cycles, each ecosystem's abiotic and biotic features are distinct from each other.
- All functions of ecosystem in some way related to growth/regeneration of its plant/animal species. These interlinked processes can be depicted as various cycles; absorbed by plants; oxygen is released into atmosphere. During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide is for their respiration.
- Water cycle depends on atmosphere. Animals depend on this oxygen for respiration. Energy cycle recycles nutrients into soil (necessary for plants); own lives are closely linked to proper functioning of these cycles of life. Plant life grows. Our own altering them, humanity cannot survive on earth. If human activities go on altering them.

#### 3.4.1 The Water Cycle
- Hydrologic cycle (known as water cycle): Collects, purifies, circulates Earth's finite water supply. When it rains, water runs along ground and flows into rivers or falls directly into sea. Part of rainwater that falls on land percolates into ground; flows into rivers or falls nutrients from soil. The water then is drawn up from ground by plants along with blow the clouds for long distances; when cloud vapour rises and forms clouds. The winds to the atmosphere. As it is lighter than air, water vapour as water along with.

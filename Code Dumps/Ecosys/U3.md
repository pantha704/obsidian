### Concept of an Ecosystem
Ecosystem: Region with specific landscape (forest, grassland, desert, wetland, coastal) shaped by climate, sunlight, temperature, rainfall. Includes abiotic (non-living: soil, air, water) and biotic (living: plants, animals) components. Divided into terrestrial (land-based) and aquatic (water-based). Life exists in thin biosphere layer.

### Geographical Realms
Sub-global divisions: Eurasia (Palearctic), South/Southeast Asia (Oriental), North America (Nearctic), South America (Neotropical), Africa (Ethiopian), Australia (Australian). Each has distinct geography like Himalayas, Ganges plains, Deccan plateau, influencing local ecosystems (forests, grasslands, rivers, mangroves).

### Understanding Ecosystems
Natural: Forests, grasslands, deserts, aquatic (ponds, rivers, lakes, sea). Human-modified: Agricultural, urban. Observe via field studies in urban/natural areas. Structure: Layers (forest: ground to canopy; pond: periphery to center). Composition: Well-known plants/animals common/rare. Function: Biogeochemical cycles, energy transfer via food chains, nutrient cycles. Biotic/abotic interact.

### Resource Utilization
Traditional societies used resources sustainably; inequality grew with population. Affluent overused (timber, fuelwood), leading to scarcity. Need equitable distribution, reduce pressures for natural sharing.

### Structure and Functions of an Ecosystem
**Structure**: Non-living (water, inorganic substances, climate) + living (plants from extremophiles to large; animals). Components: Inorganic (C, N, CO2, H2O), organic (proteins, carbs, lipids), climatic (temp, moisture, light, topography), producers (plants, phagotrophs), macro-consumers (animals), micro-consumers (saprotrophs like fungi).

**Functions**: Energy cycles, food chains, diversity, nutrient/biogeochemical cycles, evolution.

### Producers, Consumers, Decomposers
**Producers**: Plants make food via sun energy (tiny algal forms to large seaweeds).

**Consumers**: Herbivores (primary: insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals grazing plants/foliage). Carnivores (secondary: tigers, leopards, jackals, foxes, fish; eat herbivores). Omnivores eat both.

**Decomposers**: Detritivores (worms, insects, bacteria, fungi) break dead matter into nutrients for reuse. Ecosystems complex with many species; some endemic/rare.

### Energy Flow in the Ecosystem
Interrelated cycles (water, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen) affect life. Energy from sun via photosynthesis (plants absorb, release O2; CO2 for respiration). Animals depend on plants/O2. Nutrient recycling into soil. Human activities alter balance, causing species extinction.

### The Water Cycle
Collects/purifies/circulates water: Rain falls on land, percolates to groundwater/aquifers, flows to rivers/seas. Evaporates from leaves/ground to atmosphere (lighter than air), forms clouds via winds/condensation, rains again. Finite supply; essential for life.
